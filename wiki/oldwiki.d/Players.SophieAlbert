Her hair is a deep brown that gets hints of gold to it when the light hits it just right; her eyes a soulful brown capable of mischievous glimmering and an eager, happy gleam. Her features are the kind referred to as classical beauty; high cheekbones, plush lips, etcetera. She has that kind of effortless style and class that, usually, requires quite a lot of work. She's happy to beautify by more or less make-up, from shimmering lip-glosses to a deeper or more seductive hue of lipstick, from vibrant shades of eye shadow to go with her wardrobe, or just a light touch to accentuate what nature's given her.%25%25%0a%0a%25lfloat text-align=center margin-top=5px margin-right=15px margin-bottom=5px margin-left=0px newwin%25[[https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/43400366/Sophie/Sophie009.jpg | https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/43400366/Sophie/Sophie005.jpg"Song in a Secret Garden"]]%25color=#005826%25Her body has curves; dangerously so. And, as noted, she stands tall and takes pride in it, moving with a sway of the hip, happy to offer good Southern diet and taking pleasure in her life as the secret to her success; from her long and gracious limbs to the rounded swell of hip and bosom, from the gleam of her skin to the lustre of her hair - and of course, the voracius appetite she has for life itself.%0a%0a%25color=#005826%25To those with eyes that can see, there are some slight differences. Foremost, that there's always a hint of green on her fingertips; the mark of her Order. In addition, the glow to her skin is stronger, a golden gleam, as though she was lit from within with a warm candle. And when the ambient light catches her just right, or indeed, when it grows too low, there's a hint of crimson to it; a shade sinister mixed with three shades alluring. Her nails seem perhaps just a little sharper, her teeth just a little whiter - all the better to... No, best not think about that. %0a%0a%25color=#005826%25The Mantle of Spring surrounds her; felt mostly in the warmth of her touch - literally; her skin has the heat of someone who's been lying in the sun all day - and the scent of apples and honey that teases into whatever perfume she might be wearing.%0a[[%3c%3c]]%0a%0a%25rfloat text-align=center margin-top=5px margin-right=0px margin-bottom=5px margin-left=15px newwin%25[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evu3I0ZoERc |https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/43400366/Sophie/Sophie006.jpg"In the Temple of Love you hide together"]]%0a%25color=#005826%25Her wardrobe is extensive, as Sophie has friends both in high and low places - and probably along the horizontal axies as well. Other than variations depending on her crowd, though, there are a few common threads to spin on; in terms of colour, she favours brighter tones and pastels. Cut and shape to emphasise and accentuate her form; to flatter her body and show off her assets, be it through a tight pair of jeans or a skirt that adds an aesthetic flare to her curve, a high-necked and shapely sweater, or a dress with a plunging neckline. Dress for success, baby, no matter the goal. %0a%0a%25lfloat text-align=center margin-top=5px margin-right=0px margin-bottom=5px margin-left=15px newwin%25[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qkuu0Lwb5EM |https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/43400366/Sophie/Rex001.jpg"Rex, the Helpful Hound"]]%0a%0a%0a%0a%25color=#005826%25'''And then there's ''Rex'', the Helpful Hound.'''%0a%0a%25color=#005826%25Rex is a rather large dog, reminiscent of an Irish Wolfhound. Standing a little over three feet at the shoulder - unless he gets up on his hindlegs, he's way over seven feet then. His frame is lean, his fur is shaggy, and his bright blue eyes have a hint of that blank stare so full of doggy wisdom. Of general good demeanour, Rex will be happy to rest his head in any laps that present themselves, and obliges the city leash laws when moving around with Sophie, for the most part - though she sometimes leaves him to carry his leash by his own.%25%25%0a%0a>>lrindent frame padding=30 bgcolor=#00CC00%3c%3c%0a%25color=#CCCCCC%25'''The Helpful Hound''' %0a%0a%25color=#CCCCCC%25''Spring Goodwill 2, Perfect Stillness, Trained Observer (3)''%25%25%0a>>%3c%3c%0a[[%3c%3c]]%0a%0ahttp://wantonwicked.gamingsandbox.com/wiki/images/ctl/headers/ctl_h.png%0a%25rfloat text-align=center margin-top=5px margin-right=0px margin-bottom=5px margin-left=15px newwin%25[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V53PB3jXio |https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/43400366/Sophie/Sophie010.jpg"I must confess I wonder, if you will like my flowers"]]%25color=#005826%25Sophie joined the freehold of Rose Dhu in late May 2012, alongside Rex (who, technically, didn't join so much as come along as a package deal).

Her hair is a deep brown that gets hints of gold to it when the light hits it just right; her eyes a soulful brown capable of mischievous glimmering and an eager, happy gleam. Her features are the kind referred to as classical beauty; high cheekbones, plush lips, etcetera. She has that kind of effortless style and class that, usually, requires quite a lot of work. She's happy to beautify by more or less make-up, from shimmering lip-glosses to a deeper or more seductive hue of lipstick, from vibrant shades of eye shadow to go with her wardrobe, or just a light touch to accentuate what nature's given her.%25%25%0a%3c %0a%3c %25lfloat text-align=center margin-top=5px margin-right=15px margin-bottom=5px margin-left=0px%25https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/43400366/Sophie/Sophie005.jpg%0a%3c %25color=#005826%25Her body has curves; dangerously so. And, as noted, she stands tall and takes pride in it, moving with a sway of the hip, happy to offer good Southern diet and taking pleasure in her life as the secret to her success; from her long and gracious limbs to the rounded swell of hip and bosom, from the gleam of her skin to the lustre of her hair - and of course, the voracius appetite she has for life itself.%0a%3c %0a%3c %25color=#005826%25Her wardrobe is extensive, as Sophie has friends both in high and low places - and probably along the horizontal axies as well. Other than variations depending on her crowd, though, there are a few common threads to spin on; in terms of colour, she favours brighter tones and pastels. Cut and shape to emphasise and accentuate her form; to flatter her body and show off her assets, be it through a tight pair of jeans or a skirt that adds an aesthetic flare to her curve, a high-necked and shapely sweater, or a dress with a plunging neckline. Dress for success, baby, no matter the goal.%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %25rfloat text-align=center margin-top=5px margin-right=0px margin-bottom=5px margin-left=15px%25https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/43400366/Sophie/Rex001.jpg%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %25color=#005826%25And then there's Rex! Boon companion! The Helpful Hound!%0a%3c %0a%3c %25color=#005826%25Rex is a rather large dog, reminiscent of an Irish Wolfhound. Standing a little over three feet at the shoulder - unless he gets up on his hindlegs, he's way over seven feet then. His frame is lean, his fur is shaggy, and his bright blue eyes have a hint of that blank stare so full of doggy wisdom. Of general good demeanour, Rex will be happy to rest his head in any laps that present themselves, and obliges the city leash laws when moving around with Sophie, for the most part - though she sometimes leaves him to carry his leash by his own. %0a---%0a> %25color=#005826%25Sophie is a curvaceous African-American woman who often adds to her already impressive 5' 11" with a couple of inches in heels. %0a61d47%0a%3c %0a
