Aaron favors confortable clothing, usually sweatsuits, or the baggy set up when he doesn't wishes to be harassed by the Man merely on account of his ink, always in gang-neutral colors.''%0a%0a[[%3c%3c]]%0a%25%25http://wantonwicked.gamingsandbox.com/wiki/images/wtf/headers/wtf_h.png%0a[[%3c%3c]]%0a''When younger, Aaron ran with a small time crew.
