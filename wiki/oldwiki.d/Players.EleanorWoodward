Eleanor's chestnut brown hair barely dusting the tops of her shoulders feathered back away from her full features. Her clothing changes day to day usually earth tones, matched with a red here or there, shoes are always something comfortable. Make up is almost always light unless dressing up on occasion. She is not shy but clothing is almost always covering up her body leaving almost nothing to have a sneak peak at. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c [[%3c%3c]]%0a%3c %25right%25http://i.imgur.com/RYDlulP.png%0a%3c %25lfloat text-align=center margin-top=5px margin-right=15px margin-bottom=5px margin-left=0px width=275 newwin%25http://i.imgur.com/j7aFYcH.jpg%0a%3c %0a%3c ->%25color=#78724C%25 Eleanor grew up in Thomas ville, GA.
