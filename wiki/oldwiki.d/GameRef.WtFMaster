You might think that you're warm and comfortable in your cities and homes, but the wolves are hiding outside your door. They grow hungry for the Hunt and you've been too ignorant to understand why they hate you. No, I don't think running will help; but it will make the Hunt enjoyable."''%0a%0a'''You''' are one of the Forsaken. '''You''' are the heir to a lineage and duty older than man's history. '''You''' must find the balance between the rage-filled instincts of the Wolf and your own human reason or be put down like the mindless beast you fear you'll become. There are enemies everywhere, both from without and within; but you are not alone.%0a%0aThe pack is with you. They are closer than your blood. They are deeper than family. You can love them or hate them, but the pack is the only thing that will ever understand you. There is nothing outside the pack. There is nothing but an early grave.%0a%0a%0a!! Werewolf the Forsaken%0a%0a%0aWelcome to Werewolf the Forsaken. Werewolf is a Storytelling game of savage horror. It is a game of violence and savagery, relationships of pack, and spiritual exploration. The themes of werewolf are varied, but the biggest theme is always the Hunt. %0a%0aThe Oath proclaims to werewolves that the Wolf Must Hunt. It doesn't matter what the wolf hunts, only that he does so. To deny this basic predatory nature is to deny what you are and is often the first step towards becoming one of the wretched Zi'ir, a Broken Soul with nothing but the vague cunning of a man and the ravenous appetite of a monster. %0a%0aThe other themes that the Storytelling team will be looking to explore are:%0a%0aThe spirit world and its hatred of the Forsaken. How do local werewolves deal with the Shadow, and what enemies have they made in their attempts to keep the Balance between flesh and spirit?%0a%0aThe relationship between the hunter and the hunted, and what hunts the werewolves.%0a%0aThe differences between uratha and human culture. We will explore a world stained with violence that outsiders would think savage and brutal, but is considered normal to the local werewolf population.%0a%0aThe importance of the Wolfblooded and their role in keeping werewolves connected to humanity beyond simply breeding.%0a%0aThe laws of the Oath and its different interpretations and its influence on individual pack culture.%0a%0aThis is for the IC Setting information for Werewolf the Forsaken%0a[[#IntroductionEnd]]%0a%0a!!History%0a[[#History]]%0ahttp://wantonwicked.gamingsandbox.com/wiki/images/wtf/history/wtf1.jpg%0a%0a'''(Pre-1732)-''' The Native Americans that lived in the area before colonization had werewolves that were primarily of the Blood Talon tribe, with heavy influence from the Lodge of Wendigo. The Lodge of Wendigo is a lodge that has secret rituals for gleaning secrets and skills from consuming the flesh of your enemies. Their totem, the infamous Wendigo, has always maintained a often overlooked presence in the area.%0a%0a'''(1732)-''' The British arrive, led by General James Oglethorpe. The colonists are mostly humans, but there is one Wolf-blooded Family and their werewolf relations that comes over. This pack is made primarily of Bone Shadows. They have a few things in common with the Bone Shadows that exist amongst the Natives, and tribal relationships among the werewolves actually fosters the healthy relationship that fostered among the English colonists and the Natives here.%0a%0a'''(1736)-''' The Face Witch is killed by the combined efforts of the packs. The Witch had been an old enemy of the werewolves for years before British colonists arrived. The witch had been, in fact, a powerful and corrupt mage that maintained a great amount of lore on shapeshifting and the art of stealing the flesh of her victims and taking their appearances. This power she used to experiment on werewolves she managed to capture, trying to steal their power. Her writings are presumed destroyed, but the contents are secretly maintained by one of the packs.%0a%0a'''(1752)-''' There exist several werewolf packs scattered among the wilderness and in the colonist settlement. These packs sometimes fight one another over territory and exceptional humans or wolf-blooded that attract intents to breed. %0a%0a'''(1754)-''' Georgia becomes an official royal colony. This receives mixed reactions from the local packs. The werewolves, for the most part, don't care; but the influx of slavery begins to attract the Pure Tribes and they begin to create a foothold in the colony.%0a%0aThis breeds an era of violent turmoil as the Forsaken close ranks to resist the advances of the Pure in both the flesh and the spirit. The concept of slavery is tolerated by some of the Forsaken packs later, but packs that either endorse the practice have a high rate of members who join the Pure; lured by their speeches of dominance over humanity.%0a%0aThe Forsaken lend their assistance to the Quakers and other mortal groups that facilitate the Underground Railroad, disrupting slave trading whenever possible to strike at Pure influence in the colony.%0a%0a'''(1773)-''' The Natives, specifically the Creek and Cherokee, secede more land to the English. This causes a change in the spirit world as young artificial-spirits begin to become more common and nature-spirits begin to fight back. The different broods and choirs gain support from different packs, and rivalries begin to cause bloodshed.%0a%0aThe fight with the Pure is put on hold, and slavery continues unabated while the Forsaken struggle between themselves. This brings some of the same effect among the Pure, but not to the same extent.%0a%0aThere is a marked rise in Rites of Initiation being conducted for newly changed joining the Iron Masters. The Fire Touched heighten their own attempts at recruitment by infiltrating local churches, delivering fire and brimstone speeches and targeting mortal groups through religious zealotry. This campaign is resisted by the Iron Masters and Bone Shadows who spread a message of Enlightenment and some of the early literature leading to the American Revolution is influenced by the Tribes of the Moon.%0a%0a'''(1778 American Revolution)-''' British and Loyalist troops primarily control the city for much of the war. There are several sieges to take the city by American and French forces, but they fail. The werewolves are too embroiled with their own conflicts, but some packs help the American and French forces covertly by delivering anonymous intelligence.%0a%0aThe Pure, for their part, do not care for either cause. They are restricted in their movements by the heavy presence of troops. There is an unofficial ceasefire between the two warring factions of werewolves.%0a%0a'''(1864 American Civil War)-''' The Pure Tribes, with their holdings in the slave market and plantations back the Confederacy. The Union by default receives the backing of the Tribes of the Moon, many local packs of Forsaken are brought into a deadly "civil war" of their own as werewolves from both factions move to slaughter and burn the holdings and loved ones of their enemies.%0a%0aThe writings and techniques of the old witch that the packs had killed in 1736 resurface. These occult rituals are used on wolf-blooded who are unlikely to experience the First Change, adding a mass of new shapeshifters to the forces of the Forsaken. This brings mixed reactions from some of the Native American packs, but this action turns the tide and allows the Union forces to take hold.%0a%0aIt is two months into Union occupation that General Sherman begins introducing his concept of "total war." The destruction caused by the Union forces and the slaughter of those they captured breeds dark places in the spirit world. The Union brings the end of slavery, but births many new terrors that the weakened Forsaken must struggle to contain. The Pure Tribes go into hiding to lick their wounds.%0a%0a'''(19th Century)-''' The Forsaken begin to fall to fighting among themselves. The different packs begin to fight over resources and territory. This soon begins what the werewolves call the Brethren War, when the Pure Tribes rise up and begin taking territories. They kill or convert any werewolves they encounter. %0a%0aThe local packs are pushed to the brink before one of the packs rises to push back the Pure Tribes, gathering a collective of packs beneath them. This is the start of the Clutch...%0a%0a'''(Modern Day)-''' The Forsaken have reclaimed many of the territories that they had lost during the Brethren War, but are divided clearly into lines of North and South. To the South the Pure Tribes hold sway with their message of hate and manipulate the mortal populations through hate groups, spirit possession, and extreme religious doctrine.%0a%0aThe Tribes of the Moon hold the territories to the North of the city. They maintain a powerful collection of loci and resources, but are constrained by instincts that refuse any kind of central governance. The Alpha pack however has continued to hold themselves above the other "lesser packs" and maintained a firm grip on control, creating a dangerous and violent game of politics where cunning and strength are both needed in equal measure.%0a[[#HistoryEnd]]%0a%0a!!Location%0a[[#Location]]%0a!WtF Locations%0a%0a%25lfloat text-align=center margin-top=5px margin-right=15px margin-bottom=5px margin-left=0px%25http://wantonwicked.gamingsandbox.com/wiki/images/wtf/locations/wtf1.jpg%0a%0a!!The Tur%0a%0a''"What? Werewolves forming a city-state? I thought all shapeshifters just killed each other."'' - Deceased Intruder%0a%0aThe grounds you enter are a clearing within the wilderness. It is a space surrounded by mighty trees that stretch up into the skyline like jagged teeth. The center of the clearing is dominated by a rock formation, altered by the Gifts of the People and inscribed with holy markings and sigils in reverence to all the things held most sacred by werewolves. %0a%0aThere are many smaller boulders and rocks that surround the formation, providing seating at various heights. Those with greater status or influence in the city-state of werewolves are given seats closer to the a throne of bone and trophies located at the top. The pinnacle of the formation is as cold as winter's first breathe no matter the season. %0a%0aThe throne is a pile of bones of various creatures, weapons, and trophies; cobbled and held together by ice and frost. The icey throne is blessed by powerful rituals, marking the area as a caern. This is where the Lord Alpha sits when he is listening to the requests and reports of the lesser packs.%0a%0a'''ACTIVE EFFECTS:''' Creating the Caern, Ward Against Humans, Ward Against Rage, Bind Human, Rite of Chosen Ground%0a%0a• Werewolves attempting violence against one%0aanother feel compelled not to do so, as if their limbs%0aresist the very action. They can still attack, but doing%0aso incurs a –4 penalty. (Defending from an attack,%0ahowever, does not incur such a penalty.) The resistance%0a(and thus, the penalty) can be removed if the%0awerewolf wishing to bring about violence spends a%0aWillpower point.%0a%0a• Upon approaching the cairn, every werewolf%0amust choose a Social Skill bonus. This bonus%0aprovides a +1 die to any of the following Social%0aSkills: Empathy, Expression, Persuasion, Socialize%0aor Subterfuge. The werewolf must choose one of%0athese Skills to boost while within the cairn’s radius%0aof effect. This bonus is only good while within the%0acairn’s radius of effect. The Skill bonus is locked in%0auntil the next phase of the moon reaches its apex, at%0awhich point the werewolf can choose to change the%0abonus or keep it.%0a%0a• It is harder to enter Kuruth while within the%0aaffected cairn radius. Rolls to resist Death Rage are%0amade at a +3 modifier.(Additional +1 for Ward Against Rage)%0a%0a• There is a resonance of Community that offers a +1 to all appropriate social rolls, such as Socialize, Persuasion, Empathy, etc.%0a%0a!!The Skinner Family Estate%0a%0ahttp://www.cgw.com/images/media/News/Marc/DarkShadowsAfter-Castle.jpg%0a%0aYou see before you an old gothic-style manor, decorated by well kept lawns and gardens. The family crest, a wolf's head carrying a ring in its mouth, is reflected in much of the estate's architecture and design. There are three wings to the manor, offering an abundance of rooms for visiting members of the family or guests. The grounds of the estate lie close to the nearby swamps of Skidrow Island, casting a dark feeling upon the building and its inhabitants.%0a%0a* The Grounds: The grounds outside the estate are covered in green and fenced off. The area is reasonably secluded from outside eyes and allows many hiding places to shapeshift without witnesses.%0a%0a* The Main Hall: This is the greeting hall where visitors to the family estate are greeted by the Wolf-Blooded and Skinchangers living here. This entryway has several hallways leading to other parts of the estate.%0a%0a* West-Wing: The western wing of the estate is mostly filled with bedrooms. They are luxurious and comfortable, offering soft beds and shelter for family members who are looking for a place to stay.%0a%0a* East-Wing: The eastern wing of the estate is where you'll find the library, study, kitchens, dining room, and the office for the current Family Head. It is easily the busiest section of the house with family members moving between the various rooms to handle dinner preparations, study up on the occult, or practice their taxidermy.%0a%0a'''Resonance:''' Secrets%0aTerritory: Skidaway Island (Keepers of the Marsh Territory)%0a%0a!!The Pinkerton Station%0a'''District:''' Historic District%0a%0a%25width=730%25http://i.imgur.com/5HTMT2w.jpg %0a%0aKitchen open 24/7 %0a%0aNo alcohol 3 AM to 7AM Monday through Saturday.%0aNo Alcohol 2:55 AM Sunday til 7 AM Monday%0a%0aBadges, guns, and police man blue dominate the bar. The police of Savannah tend to congregate at this bar after their shifts. People with warrents or gang colors quickly find themselves interrogated or arrested if they wander into the bar.%0a%0aIronically enough a number of small crimes happen daily in The Pinkerton Station perpetuated by the police. Police officers will usually be playing cards and gambling at a table. Underage servers, always of direct relation to police officers, will stay clocked in once the liquor starts flowing and keep serving patrons. Children can often be spotted on a bar stool being supervised by the bartender as they wait for their police parents to get off shift.%0a%0a* The Backroom: There is a room located in the back of the kitchen where raw meat is served to werewolves with a developed taste for flesh and blood. The room bares a resemblance to a slaughter house with "delicacies" hanging on hooks from the ceiling. The floor is outfitted with grates to allow for blood to be easily hosed down the drains from the carnivorous appetites of its patrons. It is a place where werewolves can shed their skins and enjoy a meal out-of-sight of the Herd.%0a%0a'''Resonance:''' Hunger\\%0a'''Territory:''' This diner is considered neutral ground claimed as part of the Hegemony's protectorate.%0a[[#LocationEnd]]%0a%0a[[#Law]]%0a!The Oath of the Moon%0a%0aThe werewolves of Savannah are not beholden to humanity's laws. They use a different code of conduct to judge themselves and each other. These laws are ancient and passed down from ancient times by Mother Moon and her lunes. Yet not every pack or Elodoth interprets the laws in the same light. Yet generally most packs can agree on certain laws meaning the same thing. If there are any contentions as to the meaning of the law, it is best to adhere to the intepretation of the pack's territory that you are in - or else seek to take their territory away.%0a%0a!!!!The Wolf Must Hunt%0a%0aIt does not matter what the wolf hunts, only that it does. This is the most basic tenet of the Oath and speaks to the nature of the uratha as predators. If a predator does not take up the Hunt - either for territory, sustenance, or simply pleasure they are seen as denying a vital part of werewolf existence. This could weigh on their souls, and other werewolves may perceive them as lazy and weak.%0a%0a!!!!The People Do Not Murder The People%0a%0aIn Savannah, the local packs tend to agree that the "People" are only those werewolves who are members of the Tribes of the Moon. If a werewolf has not pledged himself to the Oath or has joined the ranks of the Pure there will be little reprecussion for their death. It is possible for packs to perceive any werewolf not of the pack as being not of the People. Thus any werewolf traversing through unfamiliar territory had best take care, lest he turn form hunter into hunted.%0a%0a!!!!The Low Honor The High; The High Respect The Low%0a%0aThis law serves as a lesson against hubris, yet is commonly the most broken vow. The majority of packs offer those of renown and accomplishment their due, yet there are some others who respect only strength and those with the power to ''make'' them listen. In either scenario, the Alpha-pack of the Whispering Pines Hegemony is considered the highest authority in Savannah. Lord Frostbite regularly holds meetings with the leadership of the local packs, settling disputes or trying desperately to keep the grudges between the packs in check.%0a%0a!!!!Respect Your Prey%0a%0aThis law is much like the previous, but carries with it certain significance. The werewolves prey upon spirits, hosts, humans, and sometimes stranger creatures. This law primarily is meant to be certain that the uratha do not abuse either their spirit charges or their human relations. They may hold power over flesh and spirit, but restraint is respected and expected from the leadership. This doesn't always happen, and often the Wolf-Blooded or unaffiliated mortals are the victims of packs who do not cling so tightly to this tenet.%0a%0a!!!!The Uratha Shall Cleave To The Human%0a%0aThis is the only law of the Oath that is held completely inviolate in Savannah. There is no excuse for its breach, and werewolves that trespass into this taboo may face exile or grisly execution. If a female werewolf is pregnant with a growing Ghost Child, it is likely that the local packs will seek to kill her to prevent its birth. The father may receive more mercy, but that is up to the individual pack that captures him.%0a%0a!!!!Do Not Eat The Flesh Of Man Or Wolf%0a%0aThere may be instances where a werewolf loses control. That is to be expected. There are no werewolves who can claim to have never felt the death of their minds, consumed in their Rage. Yet werewolves are expected to abstain from eating the flesh of humans or wolves or, worse yet, their own kind. There are rumors of packs of Predator Kings that lurk out in the deep wilderness that sometimes venture closer to the city, causing disappearances of hikers or rural folk. The rumors say that they feast on the flesh of men. It shows the Tribes just how far they can potentially fall if they ignore this tenet. All packs enforce this law, and breaches are usually handled in pack.%0a%0a!!!!The Herd Must Not Know%0a%0aThis law is typically enforced by sending in clean-up crews of Wolf-Blooded or lower ranking werewolves in the Hegemony after a reported breach. The secrecy of the uratha must be maintained, but sometimes the packs are driven into a corner and must fight or die. However, acting in a manner or taking actions that risk the exposure of the uratha is cause for harsh and vicious punishment. If a werewolf can not clean up their mistakes they may find the local packs soon knocking on her door.%0a%0a!!Punishment and Enforcement%0a%0a* Every pack is expected to police and manage their own members. Failure to do so adequately may attract the attention of their neighbors, resulting perhaps in withdrawal of resources and aid against the local Pure Tribes or even outright hostility.%0a%0a* Individual werewolves without a pack are afforded less protection than those with a pack. If you're packless and accused of committing a breach of the Oath, expect to be treated harshly. Thus, there is more encouragement to become a member of a pack for that political protection.%0a%0a* If a pack falls so low in Harmony as to display signs of obvious degeneration or the development of bans, it's possible they may gain the attention of the Alpha-pack. To date, there has been no such case of an entire pack falling to such extremes. It is unknown what measures would be taken if any of the lesser packs did fall so low.%0a[[#LawEnd]]%0a%0a!Cast Content%0a%0a!!Society%0a[[#Society]]%0a*[[#Hegemony|Whispering Pines Hegemony]]%0a**[[#Org|Organization]]%0a**[[#LP|Lesser Packs]]%0a**[[#Oath|The Oath of the Moon]]%0a*[[#WB|Wolf-Blooded Families]]%0a%0a%0a!! The Whispering Pines Hegemony%0a* The Lords of Mourning Glory (The Alpha Pack)%0a%0a''"The Morning Glory has been at the top of the food chain in pack politics since they took power after the Brethren War. They're fucking tough sons-of-bitches. There are some among the People that think they're too high for our own good, but you won't see me growling it where they can hear."'' - Crooked Grin, Alpha of the Dirty Dozen%0a%0a'''Membership:''' 5 Members (All Auspices)%0a%0a'''Alpha:''' [[Players.Eddie Reynolds|Eddie Reynolds]] (Lord Frostbite)%0a%0a!!!Organization%0a%0aThe Lords of Mourning Glory are organized in a traditional pack setup and are one of the few packs to maintain a member of each auspice. They are made up of veterans of the Brethren War, each auspice represented by an Elder. The pack is primarily constructed of Storm Lords, but claims one Hunter-in-Darkness as its Irraka. The pack maintains the fealty of several "lesser" packs with less experienced members who take advantage of the older pack's knowledge and social standing. The lesser packs serve as enforcers, each pack's totem possessing loyalty to Mourning Glory's Ithaeur for binding them to their current children through moonlit rituals. The members of the pack are:%0a%0a* Eddie Reynolds (Alpha - Cahalith / Storm Lord / Lodge of Thunder)%0a* Micha Forerunner (Second - Elodoth / Storm Lord / Lodge of Winter)%0a* Aaron Dahl (Ithaeur / Hunter-in-Darkness / Lodge of the Shephard)%0a* Mike Tanner (Irraka / Storm Lord / Lodge of Crows)%0a* Buck One-Eye (Rahu / Storm Lord / Lodge of Thunder)%0a%0a!!!The Enforcer Packs%0a%0aThere are three packs that owe fealty to the Alpha pack. These packs are young and brash werewolves, easily impressed by displays of strength and dominance. The Mourning Glory keeps a leash on their charges by possessing knowledge of each totem's ban and possessing rites to summon, bind, or discorporate a totem if any of the lesser packs become unwilling to listen to instructions.%0a%0aThis makes the enforcers of the Mourning Glory compliant, but also slightly resentful. Yet still what these packs are getting out of the arrangement is more than what they're losing...for now. The packs each claim memberships in different lodges, with some being more prominent than others. There are members of every tribe represented among the numbers of the lesser packs. The packs are:%0a%0a* Hellriders / Membership: 15 (Totem: Iron Horse)%0a* Dirty Dozen / Membership 12 (Totem: Snapping Dog)%0a* Bad Moon Rising / Membership 7 (Totem: Old Creeper)%0a%0aIn recent days the lesser packs, by extension, each control anywhere from three to five lesser packs as 'vassals' in their territories. These packs are made up of young freshly changed werewolves who were rescued or recruited before the Pure Tribes could lay claim to them. This has created a system of fealty between packs of differing power, with some owing loyalty to more powerful packs.%0a%0aThose younger packs that accept becoming part of a stronger pack's 'fiefdom' are granted territory that has mostly been tamed and tended by the ruling pack. They need only take up responsibility for the hard work that was already done and come when their patron calls.%0a%0a!!!The Oath of the Moon%0a%0a''See: [[Players.WtFLaw|Werewolf Law: Oath of the Moon]]''%0a%0aThe laws of the Oath are open to interpretation depending on who you ask. However, even among the contentious ranks of the Tribes of the Moon, there are some general guidelines that are observed...%0a%0a* Those packs that are members of the Hegemony are free to interpret the Oath as they see fit within their territories. The rule of an individual pack and their leadership is law as long as they can continue to hold their territory.%0a%0a* The People Do Not Murder The People: This law has a more liberal interpretation in the Clutch. The Pure Tribes are not considered to be "of the People," and some packs even go so far as to include non-affiliated werewolves as well.%0a%0a[[#WB]]%0a!!Wolf-Blooded Families%0a%0aThere are several families of Wolf-Blooded that exist in Savannah and just as many werewolves that claim blood ties or marriage to members of these families. Wolf-Blooded see more interaction with werewolves than usual, and some try to curry favor with the packs in hopes of gaining advantage over rival families, family members, or to improve their social standing among the packs.%0a%0aThe wolf-blooded tend to interact with humanity on behalf of their lycanthropic brethren. There are some that do so out of a sense of familial duty, or perhaps they mistakenly believe that currying favor will somehow earn them the same powers as the werewolves. This is a mistaken belief, but it is not without a source. There is one pack in particular that  keeps knowledge of skinchanging rituals stolen from an old witch that was an ancient enemy of the People.%0a%0aThis knowledge is taught to Wolf-Bloods that prove themselves and are unlikely to experience the First Change. The Blooded are often used to try and gain advantage over rival packs, or to clean up after the werewolves' hunting of the threats that hide in the darkness of Savannah's swamps and back alleys.%0a%0a:The Skinners:This Wolf-Blooded Family maintains secrets of Skinchanging, closely guarded by the werewolves that control them. They have branched into several smaller branch families that work on behalf of the uratha. (Possible Sur-Names: Dorian, Tanner, Dahl)%0a%0a:The Pinkertons:This Wolf-Blooded Family typically has involved themselves in law enforcement. This may not be true of every family member, but typically members of this family have gone on to become police officers and sheriffs. The family maintains a close connection to the police and the District Attorney.%0a%0a:The Reynolds: There are some Wolf-Blooded that are more impacted by the touch of the Shadow than others. This Family is one such case. The members have been known to be the targets of spirit possession and worse, but such attention from the spirits has also granted them access to strange alien connections in the Shadow and thus the ability to act as mediums. The Family claims an old Native American heritage, and members that have those features are considered of "finer breeding" than those without.%0a[[#SocietyEnd]]%0a%0a!House Rules%0a[[#HouseRules]]%0a!!Moon Phases%0a* The current moon phase on the chat is the same as the real world. Anyone who wants to know the current moon phase can check the following lunar calendar: http://www.moonconnection.com/moon_phases_calendar.phtml%0a%0a* This also means that every moon phase receives three nights before shifting to the next moon phase. This allows werewolves three nights to reap lunar benefits such as extra essence and increased ability with shapeshifting.%0a%0a!!Wolf's Blood%0a%0a* Wolf's Blood can be used to detect the presence of Wolf-Blooded that are within scenting distance with a successful roll. This is not the automatic "on sight" of the Lodge of the Shephard ability.%0a%0a* Werewolves do not receive the -2 penalty to avoid detection when in Hishu or Urhan form against Wolf's Blood. Their natures actively call out to one another, enforcing that the human and wolf forms are for deceiving the Herd and not their own kind.%0a%0a!!Death Rage%0a%0a* Werewolves no longer check for Death Rage when they roll five or more successes on an attack. They instead check for Death Rage the first successful bite attack they make in a scene.%0a%0a* Werewolves who succumb to Death Rage may, at Storyteller discretion, begin Rage Feasting on fallen enemies they have killed. Thus control and caution of one's Rage is paramount to maintaining Harmony.%0a%0a!!Forms%0a%0a* Hishu: The Hishu form now gains the ability to scent, although not as well as a werewolf's more lupine forms. A werewolf in human form gains +1 to Perception and may track by scent at no penalty.%0a%0a* Dalu: Does not incurs the -1 penalty to track by scent.%0a%0a* Gauru: The Gauru form gains 9-again on all strength-based rolls, uses the '''HIGHER''' of Wits or Dexterity when determining Defense rating, regenerates one lethal damage every turn in addition to any wounds healed through Essence, and ignores all wound penalties and rolls to maintain consciousness from wounds.%0a%0a* Urshul: The Urshul form gains the higher of Wits or Dexterity when determining Defense rating. The Perception Bonus in this form is +4.%0a%0a* Urhan: The Urhan form uses the higher of Wits or Dexterity when determining Defense rating. The Perception Bonus in this form is +5.%0a%0a!!Dual Senses%0a%0a* Werewolves can always see spirits in Twilight, assuming those spirits are not actively attempting to avoid detection. They do not need to roll for this ability. This does not extend to other entities in Twilight.%0a%0a* Werewolves roll Wits + Occult + Primal Urge - Gauntlet Strength to get a look across the Gauntlet. They can only get a muted glance full of blurred shadows and impressions of what's happening on the other side.%0a%0a!!Wolf-Blooded%0a%0a* Wolf-Blooded use the scaling Wolf-Blooded merit detailed in Blood of the Wolf (pg. 126)%0a%0a!!Gift Errata%0a%0aMany of the below changes borrowed from LOOK on the WW forums.%0a%0a!!!Signature Renown%0a%0aOne of the greatest difficulties of the Renown system is how incredibly random the application appears to be. Within an individual Gift tree it is possible to have every single form of Renown represented. This can require players to buy up several different forms of renown, including non-favored ones to improve effects that are otherwise well within auspice theme. A lot of players are not fond of that. However, more importantly, it is confusing...really confusing. Having to record renown for each Gift, check and double check. Even for a mechanically savvy player it is a huge drag.%0a%0aEvery Gift list that follows specifies a "signature Renown". All Gifts of that tree use the Signature Renown instead of the renown listed in their description when determining bonus dice added to the roll.%0a%0aWhenever a character purchases a new Dot in a Renown they may either learn a Tribe/Auspice Gift, or any Gift that uses that Renown. Father Wolf and Mother Luna Gifts are considered to be "in Auspice" for all Uratha.

In combat this inflicts a -2 penalty to all actions through confusion and annoyance. This penalty is greater when the target's mind is less focused. If the target is caught unawares by this attack (Ambushed, for instance), or generally unfocused (standing guard on a quiet night, hung over, etc.) the penalty becomes the higher of [Cunning] or -2.%0a%0a* Blend In (oooo)%0aAdd the following: The anonymity extends to the Irraka's scent as well, and inflicts a -[Successes+Cunning] penalty on all attempts to track, chase or otherwise follow the Irraka through a crowd.

Gifts, powers, arcana which would invoke a clash roll (Resolve + Stealth + Cunning) or heighten ones senses such as reading auras compare their successes to those used in activating Playing Possum. If they beat it, they resist the mind compulsion though the werewolf still seems dead. If not, the werewolf seems dead and there's no need to do anything more about them.%0a%0a* Sand in the Eyes (ooo)%0aThe Uratha blurs his presence in the world, taking on a spirit like aspect, though one that is next to impossible to notice. It allows him to tread unremembered and unrecorded, leaving little evidence of his passing in the minds of others. Even those with whom he interacts. This effect endures for the entire scene and effects only attempt to remember the Werewolf's actions and presence within that scene.%0a-%3cCost: 1 Essence%0a-%3cDice Pool: Same%0a-%3cAction: Instant, then Contested%0a-%3cDramatic Failure: The effect backfires, everyone gains +5 to remember the Werewolf and details about him.%0a-%3cFailure: Memory is not clouded%0a-%3cSuccess: Everyone who sees the Werewolf while he is under the effects of the Gift take a -5 penalty to remember any details about him from the scene. Even technology seems to suffer, camera footage comes out blurred and security records seem to have gaping holes for the time during which he was present. The user may elect to exempt up to [Cunning] allies from the effects of Sand in the Eyes, by default all packmates are also exempted (doesn't count towards the total).%0a-%3cDramatic Success: The affected must make an Intelligence + Composure roll at -5 to remember he was there at all, all electronic records are erased completely.%0a%0a* Double Back (oooo)%0aSame effect but the Gift compares its successes against those of mystical effects, if the Werewolf rolls better those effects are trumped.%0aFog of War (ooooo)%0a-%3cCost: 1 Essence%0a-%3cDice Pool: Presence + Expression + Cunning%0a-%3cAction: Instant%0a-%3cThe werewolf releases a piercing howl, which echoes infinitely about the battlefield. With it he summons, chaos, discord and contempt. Communication and coordination collapse and chaos reigns within the field. For the remainder of the scene all attempts at communication more sophisticated than simple gestures and face-to-face discussion are automatically reduced to a chance die. Radio broadcasts come in garbled, phones lose all signal, computers fuzz up and misdisplay information, distant signs seem blurry, shouted orders fail to carry, even smoke signals are likely to be met with an unexpected wind. Communication bolstered by supernatural effects (such as an enchanted walkie-talkie, or telepathic communion) contest this effect normally, and regardless of result, the botch from the chance die cannot cause their effects to be dispelled (merely impeded for the time). %0aThe caster may choose to select individuals to be exempt from the effects of the Gift, though they must be present at the moment of invocation to do so.%0a>>%3c%3c%0a%0a!!!Stealth Gifts%0a(:toggle hide hrstg:)%0a>>id=hrstg%3c%3c%0aSwap Running Shadow and Blending's dot ratings.

Strong winds blow away prints in the sand, leaves quickly cover his footfall. This effect permanently increases the difficulty to track the Werewolf, levying a -3 penalty on all such attempts. For even greater anonymity the Werewolf may reflexively spend a point of Essence, doing so removes all physical traces of his passage what-so-ever. He leaves no foot prints and has no lingering scent, he also reduces all environmental penalties to his movement by 2. Though, this application bears some extra risk; bystanders may think it odd to see a man striding atop a six foot snow drift without sinking, or blazing through hip deep sludge at full sprint.%0a%0a* Blending (ooo)%0aChange: The user may move slowly, no more than slow walk, while the Gift is active, but Wits + Composure rolls made to spot him while he does so gain +3.%0a%0a* Shadow Flesh (ooooo)%0a-%3cCost: 2 Essence%0a-%3cDice Pool: Wits+Stealth+Cunning%0a-%3cAction: Instant%0a-%3cSuccess: The character's body becomes a two-dimentional plane of shadow that lies flat against its surroundings. He has no scent, no texture, and makes no sounds save for those he chooses to emit. However he remains a physical entity, retains the ability to interact with the physical world, albeit at a -2 penalty, and may still be affected by opponents attacks. His form appears as normal (in whichever of his forms he currently takes), however the Uratha can twist his shape to resemble other shadows. Doing so requires a successful [Dexterity+Stealth] roll to contort his form, and even then his edges tend to waver.%0aBeing a shadow grants the Werewolf a +3 bonus to steath rolls, in inflcts a -3 penalty on all rolls to notice or attack him (In areas of particularly dim lighting the Werewolf is effectively invisible, save to those with supernaturally excellent senses). In addition to these bonuses he also gains a host of mobility options. He may scale walls and ceilings with no required roll, fit through slim and narrow openings, and never needs to roll to maintain his balance. Due to his complete two dimensionality the Werewolf is also immune to any attempts to grapple or restrain him physically.%0aAll clothing and personal possessions worn change along with the character, though large unwealdly objects are left behind. Fetishes and dedicated objects always change. This form lasts for ten minutes per success, or until the Werewolf elects to end the Gift.%0a>>%3c%3c%0a%0a!!!Technology Gifts%0a(:toggle hide hrtg:)%0a>>id=hrtg%3c%3c%0a-%3cSwap Machinegeist and Create Technology's dot ratings.%0a%0a* Left-Handed Spanner (o)%0a-%3cCost: None%0a-%3cDice Pool: Wits + Crafts + Purity%0a-%3cAction: Instant%0aChange: The touched object ceases to function for the remainder of the scene. The object's owner may make an Extended Intelligence + Crafts roll to attempt to fix the object. The difficulty of said roll is equal to the number of successes rolled on Left-Handed Spanner's activation roll. The interval of the action is decided by the storyteller based on the devices complexity, along with any bonus or penalties from the character's own expertise.%0a%0a* Create Technology (oooo)%0aThe MacGyvered device functions for the remainder of the scene, or until the Werewolf stops using it (whichever is longer). Only the devices creator may use it to its full effect, for everyone else it remains a hunk of useless scrap. (A gun hobbled together from scrap metal would cease to function at the end of a fight, while a scrap car given new life might endure a full day of driving before collapsing into a heap of rust and debris.)%0a%0a* Machinegeist (ooooo)%0aIn addition to all other effects of Machinegeist, the Uratha may control the machine completely, employing it to any of the functions for which it was designed. Mundane attempts to arrest control from him (such a steering the car, or slamming on the breaks) fail, though controlling magic enters roll off.%0a>>%3c%3c%0a[[#hrcunningend]]%0a[[#hrglory]]%0a!!!Gibbous Moon Gifts%0a(:toggle hide hrgmg:)%0a>>id=hrgmg%3c%3c%0a* Pack Awareness (o)%0aThe a character can only benefit from the willpower bonus from an exceptional success once per scene.%0a%0a* Resist Pain (oo)%0a-%3cCost: 1 Essence%0a-%3cResist Pain may be given to pack mates with an inspirational word.

The user cannot gain teamwork bonuses for the remainder of the scene.%0a-%3cFailure: The speech is not inspiring%0aSuccess: The Uratha binds all subjects into a pact of unity. Everyone in the group gains +1 to resist Death Rage, (max [Glory] or [Successes], whichever is lower) for every other member within close proximity (~10 yards). Additionally all members gain a +2 modifier on all teamwork rolls to help one another. These bonuses last the remainder of the scene.%0a%0a* True Leader (ooo)%0aTrue Leader targets a single willing ally within 100 feet of the user. That person must be able to hear, or at least see the user's show of support for the Gift to function.%0a%0a* Spirit Skin (oooo) %0aChange: The social bonus does not stack with bonuses from renown, but will alleviate penalties. When two bonuses clash the higher is applied to the roll.%0a>>%3c%3c%0a%0a!!!Rage Gifts%0a(:toggle hide hrrg:)%0a>>id=hrrg%3c%3c%0a* Rekindled Rage (oooo)%0a-%3cCost: 1 Willpower (+1 Essence)%0a-%3cDice Pool: None%0a-%3cAction: Instant (Reflexive)%0aThe user may opt to spend one point of Essence instead of making the shape change roll, in which case this Gift becomes reflexive. The new rage has a duration of Stamina+Glory-1, and suffers and additional -1 to resist Death Rage. The Uratha may use Rekindled Rage any number of times within a scene, however each activation adds a cumulative -1 to Gauru's duration and the roll to resist Death Rage.%0a%0a* Fight or Flight (ooooo) (Replaces Soured Rage)%0aThe Werewolf hones his rage and directs it with laser precision at a single target. The victim is struck with a sense of absolute, primal dread and an instinctive urge to flee. %0a-%3cCost: 1 Willpower%0a-%3cDice Pool: Presence+Intimidation+Glory vs. Composure+Power Stat%0a-%3cAction: Instant%0a-%3cDramatic Failure: The Werewolf loses control over his own fury and enters Death Rage%0a-%3cFailure: The target remains steadfast%0a-%3cSuccess: The victim's higher mind is whipped away, instinct and fear now drive him. In the case of a Werewolf the target immediately enters Death Rage and attempts to flee as though one of his last three health boxes were filled. Other creatures with similar "rage" mechanics respond similarly, Vampire's enter Fear Frenzy, Prometheans plunge into Torment. Beings without naturally berserk tendencies are still filled with pure dread and compelled irresistibly to flee the scene. They may, however, opt to spend a point of willpower to divert an action towards grabbing up a loved one, or locking a door behind them (continued combat is never an option).%0a-%3cExceptional Success: Willpower may not be spent to change actions, the target can only run with all their might away from the Uratha.%0a>>%3c%3c%0a[[#hrgloryend]]%0a[[#hrhonor]]%0a!!!Half Moon Gifts%0a(:toggle hide hrhmg:)%0a>>id=hrhmg%3c%3c%0a* Scent Beneath the Surface (o)%0a-%3cDramatic Success: The Elodoth's senses are so keen that he can discern exact detail from omission alone.

The lies must all be answered in succession, so it is advised the werewolf let the victim weave their nest of untruths before breaking it.%0a%0a* Aura of Truce (ooo)%0a-%3cSame but add: If a member takes hostile action, but then elects to return to peaceful conduct he is brought back under the effects of Aura of Truce and must spend willpower to break free again.%0a%0a* Fuel Rage (oooo)%0aSame but it functions in the Shadow and may be activated repeatedly in succession prior to Gauru to stack extra turns. Fuel Rage may be used a number of times each day equal to the Werewolf's [Primal Urge/2], rounded up. Regardless of the number stacked, shifting down ends all invocations of the Gift.%0a>>%3c%3c%0a%0a!!!Shaping Gifts%0a(:toggle hide hrsg:)%0a>>id=hrsg%3c%3c%0a* Reinforce (o) [Replaces Straighten]%0a-%3cCost: 1 Essence%0a-%3cDice Pool: Intelligence + Crafts + Honor%0a-%3cAction: Reflexive%0aThe Werewolf calls upon the tiny spirit of an object, bolstering it with essence and renewing it in purpose. Each success on the activation roll adds 1 point to the object's durability for the remainder of the scene. This does not in any way repair a damaged object, nor can it grant use to an object that has been completely ruined (though he might still be able to use a reinforced object for unintended function, like bashing things). At the end of the scene the durability fades, damaged suffered does not. In many cases this can cause the object to collapse.%0a%0a* Condense or Expand (ooooo)%0aSame effect, but: Objects shrunk do not become more durable, and those enlarged do not become less so.%0a>>%3c%3c%0a%0a!!!Warding Gifts%0a(:toggle hide hrwg:)%0a>>id=hrwg%3c%3c%0a-%3cWard Against Humans is now one dot. Ward Against Predators is gone, and replaced by Ward Against Rage.%0a%0a* Ward Against Humans (o)%0aSupernatural creatures who fail the resistance roll take a -1 penalty to all actions in the area, due to the lingering sense of predatorily presence. Given the way the ward is constructed, natural predators tend to stay away as well. They can tell that it is the territory of a superior beast.%0a%0a* Ward Against Rage (oo)%0aOne of the simplest precautions a Werewolf can take to secure their territory is to defend it against his own rage, and that of others. %0a-%3cCost: None%0a-%3cDice Pool: Composure + Persuasion + Honor%0a-%3cAction: Extended (5 Successes per square mile required; one hour per roll)%0aThe Werewolf ritually walks the boundaries of her territory (a maximum area equal to one square mile per point of the character's Primal Urge). She takes the time to familiarize herself with the objects and places within, and show their spirits she means no harm. This act brings an unnatural tranquility to the zone. Add +3 to any rolls by the character to resist Death Rage within her territory. Additionally this calm spreads to other within the zone, all other Uratha (and supernaturals with a similar tendency to go berserk) gain +1 to resist Deathrage (Torment, Frenzy etc.), pack mates gain +3 instead, and all rolls made to inspire hostility, fear, or hatred are made at a -2 penalty.%0a%0a* Shadow Ward (oooo)%0a-%3cCost: 2 Essence (+1 Essence)%0a-%3cDice Pool: Inteligence+Occult+Honor%0a-%3cAction: Extended (Variable Successes, One hour per Roll)%0a-%3cChange: Each successful roll increases the penalty for crossing or seeing through the Gauntlet by one. The Werewolf may continue to reinforce the shadow for up to [Honor] hours. The difficulty of each roll varies depending on the location, generally ranging from 1 for simple rifts, to 5 for powerful Loci. Repeat invocations of this Gift do not stack, the most powerful casting takes precedence. While the effect lasts only one Lunar Cycle, it may be renewed by repaying the Gift's cost and meditating at the location for a single hour, no roll required. The renewer of the Ward need not be the original caster.%0aFor an additional point of Essence while enacting the Ward the Uratha may added exceptions, loopholes in the veil that allow certain beings easier passage. Sample exceptions include: "Is a member of the creators pack", "serves the Lodge of Black Arrows", or "Carries a key of pure gold". The exceptions themselves have no intelligence, nor can they read the motivations of others, so "Will be helpful" and "Means the pack no harm" are not viable conditions. Up to [Honor] exceptions may be placed when the ward is created, and once placed they may not be altered without first removing (or replacing) the previous ward.%0a%0a* Ward of Spirit Slumber (ooooo)%0aChange: Duration is now one minute per success. While activating the Ward he may specify nearby allies to be immune to the effect, by default all pack mates and their totem are excluded from the wards effects. The Werewolf may use this Gift as many times per day as he likes, but a Spirit need only resist it once to be immune for the next 24 hours.%0a>>%3c%3c%0a%0a!!!Weather Gifts%0a(:toggle hide hrweg:)%0a>>id=hrweg%3c%3c%0a* Silent Fog (oo)%0a-%3cCost: None%0a%0a* Killing Frost (oooo)%0a-%3cCost: 1 Essence%0a-%3cDice Pool: Manipulation+Survival+Honor%0a-%3cAction: Instant%0aSuccess: The temperature surrounding the Werewolf suddenly plunges, dropping to sub zero within 10 yards per dot of Honor (Or Primal Urge, whichever is higher). All liquid that would reasonably freeze does so immediately, surfaces frost up, rain becomes hail. Living creatures suffer worst of all, for every action spent within the freezing field they must succeed a reflexive [Stamina] roll or take two points of bashing damage. Creatures particularly vulnerable to freezing (such as sealife) take lethal damage instead, while creatures immune (Undead, Cold Spirits, Automata, etc) do not suffer. In addition, everyone in the area vulnerable to cold takes a -2 penalty to all strength and dexterity related rolls. At storyteller discresion heavy clothing and proper (or improper) preparation may add to or penalize the resistance roll.%0aThis field lasts for one turn per success on the activation roll. The caster may choose while activating this gift to attune a number of allies to the cold, immunitizing them to the Gifts effects. By default all packmates and their totem are naturally attuned. Multiple activations of this Gift do not stack, even if different characters are using it.%0a-%3cDramatic Success: the cold is so severe it deals lethal three points of bashing damage instead of two.%0a%0a* Thunderbolt (ooooo)%0a-%3cCost: 2 Essence%0a-%3cDice Pool: Manipulation+Survival+Honor - Stamina%0a-%3cAction: Instant%0a-%3cSuccess: The bolt deals two lethal damage per success. Magical armor sources (Rage Armor, Mage Armor, etc.) are added to the target's stamina when defending. As the damage is lighting based, creatures immune to electricity are unaffected (or, in Promethean's case, healed).%0a>>%3c%3c%0a[[#hrhonorend]]%0a[[#hrpurity]]%0a!!!Dominance Gifts%0a(:toggle hide hrdg:)%0a>>id=hrdg%3c%3c%0aDominance Gifts work against all supernatural entities, Werewolves and Spirits included. Spirit Rank does not prevent the Gifts effects, but can add to or penalize the roll. Subtract the difference in spirit rank between the Werewolf and his target from the Gift's dice pool (Or add it, if the Werewolf is higher rank). This bonus does not apply vs targets that have no spirit rank.%0a%0a* Warning Growl (o)%0a-%3cCost: 1 Willpower%0a-%3cAction: Reflexsive; Roll Pres + Intimidation + Honor versus Composure + Power Stat%0aSuccess: Warning Growl inflicts the target with a preternatural weariness where the Werewolf is concerned. He takes a -2 penalty to all rolls made to ''physically'' oppose or harm the Uratha for the remainder of the scene.%0a-%3cDramatic Success: The penalty increases to -3%0a%0a* Luna's Dictum (oo)%0a-%3cCost: 1 Essence%0a-%3cChange: Make the duration 30 minutes per success. Additionally the subject only refuses an order if it is obviously dangerous or against their moral code.%0a%0a* Voice of Command (ooo) [Rewrite]%0aThe Werewolf learns to carry themself with an air of utmost authority. This Gift activates automatically but is contested individually by those with whom the Werewolf interacts. %0a-%3cCost: 1 Essence%0a-%3cDice Pool: Presence + Intimidation + Purity vs Resolve + Power Stat%0a-%3cAction: Instant, then Contested (resistance is reflexive)%0aDramatic Failure: The Gift inverts itself, all present see the Uratha as utterly below them. Attempts to exert any kind of authority (including through Dominance Gifts) are at a -3 for the rest of the scene.%0a-%3cFailure: Nothing happens%0aSuccess: The subject(s) with which the Uratha interacts see him or her as their direct superior. This isn't a literal illusion, the Werewolf does not appear to be a different person, but something about his presence indicates to the subject that he has authority over them. If they are a member of some group or organization they mistake the Uratha for a superior within that hierarchy (if they are a member of several organization they will apply the most sensible one), otherwise they view the Werewolf as a sort of big brother, authority figure. Subjects take -2 to any action intended to oppose the Werewolf's authority and, more importantly, will generally follow his orders and grant him access into relevant locations and information pertinent to the organization. Though, the Storyteller may require an the Werewolf to make a Manipulation+Subturfuge roll to justify why he'd need access, if the information is sensitive enough.%0a-%3cDramatic Success: The Werewolf never needs to roll to justify their need, the victim simply assumes they MUST have a reason.%0a%0a* Tug the Soul's Strings (ooooo)%0aThe Werewolf learns to apply the principles of dominance to groups and congregations, acting with authority over many as opposed to over one. This functions much like Luna's Dictum, but on a much larger scale. The Werewolf applies the command not to a single individual, but to everyone within earshot (up to [(Purity or Primal Urge)+Successes+Extra Essence]*10 individuals) for one hour per success. Supernatural entities and meaningful NPCs resist individually, but it is advised that background characters be lumped together when rolling.%0aLike Luna's Dictum this Gift cannot cause people to perform actions that are deeply against their moral code, or clearly harmful to their wellbeing, but otherwise any order is fair game. Unlike Luna's Dictum, the sheer magnitude of people obeying quells rebellion. Subjects cannot twist the meaning of the command unless they spend a point of willpower, and will actively attempt to stop those who are trying to sabotage the order. Minor harm is not enough to break the hypnosis, only major trauma (enough to knock them unconscious) or supernatural intervention can shake them of it. %0a-%3cCost: 1 Willpower + 1 Essence for every 10 targets%0a-%3cDice Pool: Manipulation + Intimidation + Purity vs Resolve + Power Stat%0a-%3cAction: Contested; resistance is reflexive%0a-%3cDramatic Failure: The Gift fails completely, the Werewolf cannot use any Dominance Gifts for the rest of the scene.%0a-%3cFailure: Subjects do not obey, but remain unaware of the supernatural nature of the order.%0a-%3cSuccess: The subject follows the command as loyally as possible. They cannot attempt to twist the orders meaning or intent unless they pay a point of willpower (though those too dense or unskilled may still get it wrong), even then others will likely try to stop them. If faced with mortal danger, however, the subject may opt to delay their duties until safe.%0a-%3cDramatic Success: For a week after the Gift ends the subject remains more pliable towards Dominance, they suffer a -1 penalty on all rolls to resist Dominance effects for the duration.%0a>>%3c%3c%0a%0a!!!Elemental Gifts%0a(:toggle hide hreg:)%0a>>id=hreg%3c%3c%0a* Call/Alter Water (o)%0a-%3cCost: None%0a-%3cDice Pool: Wits + Survival + Glory%0a-%3cAction: Instant%0a-%3cCupping his hands the Uratha conjures water from thin air. The "water" arrives in whatever molecular state the Werewolf chooses (Solid, Liquid, Gas), though it is then subject to the natural effects of the outside temperature. Steam is never hot enough to cause injury, and ice never cold enough to harm someone without prolonged exposure. Each roll creates one cup of water, that pours/drops/spreads outward from his palms. The water is not pressurized and cannot be directed.%0aAlternatively, the Uratha may instead use this Gift to alter the chemical state of water in his surroundings. He can freeze, melt, and vaporize up to one cubic yard of water per success with a single touch. Once again, this doesn't allow him to make steam scolding hot, or ice improbably cold, nor can he shape the water in any special way outside of the ability to choose which sections change. Water that is inside a living creature is not a viable target for this effect, however the Uratha could easily freeze all the water on a wet man's skin, or melt a person sized hole in an ice cap.%0a%0a* Manipulate Earth (oo)%0aSame, but he can sculpt 100 square feet (or 40 cubic) of earth per success. The user may also sculpt man made stone, like pavement and asphalt, but the amount each success can alter is halved (about 20 cubic feet of earth). The roll may also be penalized based on the pliability of the surface.%0a%0a* Command Fire (ooo)%0aNo change, but a clarification: This gift lasts [Success] actions, and generates roughly a large bonfire's worth of flame upon activation. The user may control and direct that flame and surrounding fires for the remainder of the duration.%0a%0a* Lament of the River (ooooo)%0aThe caster may select an epicenter up to 10 miles away from his location to be the nexus of the disaster. In the absence of natural water, manmade water sources will bulge instead. Pipes burst, sewers overflow, water towers explode. All water will pool violently into the selected area and continue to ravage it for the remainder of the scene. Areas with no water at all will still moisten visibly, though it is unlikely to do much damage.%0a>>%3c%3c%0a%0a!!!Full Moon Gifts%0a(:toggle hide hrfmg:)%0a>>id=hrfmg%3c%3c%0a* Clarity (o)%0aWhen a Rahu activates this Gift he may also reflexively shift into Gauru form at no extra cost.

This armor applies equally vs standard weapons and firearms, and stacks with worn armor and armor gained from assumed forms, but not armor provided by supernatural means. Rage Armor is not bulletproof, but is unaffected by armor piercing. When the Werewolf Shifts into Gauru form he may substitute 1 willpower for the essence cost of Rage Armor and activate the power reflexively. Rage Armor is scene long.%0a%0a* Luna's Fury (ooooo) %0a-%3cCost: 1 Essence (+1 Essence every turn)%0a-%3cDice Pool: Dexterity + Brawl + Purity%0a-%3cAction: Reflexive%0a-%3cSuccess: For a number of turns per successes rolled; the werewolf must spend one essence per turn (this is not an option, they have to spend it) in exchange the Werewolf may make all-out-attacks without losing his defense, applies his defense vs Firearms, doubles it against all other incoming attacks, and is not penalized by the number of opponents. This defense bonus even applies in Gauru Death Rage, allowing the Werewolf to continue to dodge while in the throes of pure fury. The werewolf may not opt to prematurely and the gift unless they've run completely out of Essence.%0a-%3cDramatic Success: The werewolf may end the effects of the gift any time he wants.

An Uratha who knows this gift can sense these auras. When activating this Gift the Werewolf specifies a specific emotion they want to sniff out. For the remainder of the scene they can smell said emotion as well as they can any other scent. Roll Wits + Composure + Wisdom for all perception rolls to smell the chosen emotion. Creatures trying to hide their emotions may roll Composure + Power Stat to resist, and magical effects go into roll off vs. Sense Emotion.%0aThis effect endures for the duration of the scene, and the Werewolf may reactivate this Gift at any time to change the emotion for which they are hunting.

Beings, objects, locations, all fair game. The scents are nonspecific but generally give a sense of the nature of the magic and vague descriptor (person, place, or thing). Scent of Taint does not reveal the source of a magical effect, it merely makes it possible to seek out magic based on its supernatural nature alone. The Werewolf must still roll Wits + Composure to spot a supernatural entity, and hidden people/objects/locations are not automatically revealed. (Note: For the more rules obsessed, a magical occlusion effect, like invisibility or a ward, is itself considered to be occluded). (Note: The Gift user must defeat the initial activation roll of a power or effect that supernaturally conceals its user.

Only extreme trauma, such as violent shaking or receiving damage, can shake them from this trance.%0aAlternatively, they may opt to remain unspecific in which case the Storyteller is encouraged to provide them with disjointed and cryptic visions of critical challenges yet to come.

When relevant Omen Gazing will show snapshots of past and even current events.%0a-%3cDramatic Success: The vision focuses very specifically on the key components of one event, notably those that conspire to bring about that particular future, and how it may be averted.%0a>>%3c%3c%0a%0a!!!Knowledge Gifts%0a(:toggle hide hrkg:)%0a>>id=hrkg%3c%3c%0a* Traveler's Blessing (oo)%0a-%3cDuration: [Success] Hours%0a%0a* Know the Path (oooo)%0a-%3cChange: When a location has multiple inhabitants use the highest of their Resolve + Power Stat to resist.

Using this Gift a Werewolf can spread wounds and damage across their body, repositioning them to less critical locations and generally dispersing the harm. A bloody gash across the neck might be broken into a dozen smaller cuts on the arms and legs, a gaping hole in the chest might be shifted to bloody lacerations across the back. %0aThis gift cannot be used to regenerate a crippling wound, a missing eye or leg cannot be restored.

A single Aggravated wound is becomes two lethal wounds, and a single lethal wound is downgraded to two bashing. The wounds are downgraded at one point per action, for [Success] actions, starting on the action in which this Gift is activated. While active the Werewolf may take actions as normal, but suffers a -2 penalty to all physical rolls due to the shifting of his form. Only one instance of this effect may be active at any one time.%0a%0a* Primal Form (ooooo)%0a-%3cCost: 1 Essence and 1 willpower%0a-%3cDice Pool: This power requires no roll%0a-%3cAction: Instant%0aSame, but change: Primal Form is an enhancement to Gauru and consumes Gauru turns at the same rate. If the Werewolf enters Death Rage while in Primal Form (very likely), he remains in Primal Form for the duration.

Attempts to exert any kind of authority (including through Dominance Gifts) are at a -3 for the rest of the scene.%0a> -%3cFailure: Nothing happens%0a> Success: The subject(s) with which the Uratha interacts see him or her as their direct superior. This isn't a literal illusion, the Werewolf does not appear to be a different person, but something about his presence indicates to the subject that he has authority over them. If they are a member of some group or organization they mistake the Uratha for a superior within that hierarchy (if they are a member of several organization they will apply the most sensible one), otherwise they view the Werewolf as a sort of big brother, authority figure. Subjects take -2 to any action intended to oppose the Werewolf's authority and, more importantly, will generally follow his orders and grant him access into relevant locations and information pertinent to the organization. Though, the Storyteller may require an the Werewolf to make a Manipulation+Subturfuge roll to justify why he'd need access, if the information is sensitive enough.%0a> -%3cDramatic Success: The Werewolf never needs to roll to justify their need, the victim simply assumes they MUST have a reason.%0a> %0a> * Tug the Soul's Strings (ooooo)%0a> The Werewolf learns to apply the principles of dominance to groups and congregations, acting with authority over many as opposed to over one. This functions much like Luna's Dictum, but on a much larger scale. The Werewolf applies the command not to a single individual, but to everyone within earshot (up to [(Purity or Primal Urge)+Successes+Extra Essence]*10 individuals) for one hour per success. Supernatural entities and meaningful NPCs resist individually, but it is advised that background characters be lumped together when rolling.%0a> Like Luna's Dictum this Gift cannot cause people to perform actions that are deeply against their moral code, or clearly harmful to their wellbeing, but otherwise any order is fair game. Unlike Luna's Dictum, the sheer magnitude of people obeying quells rebellion. Subjects cannot twist the meaning of the command unless they spend a point of willpower, and will actively attempt to stop those who are trying to sabotage the order. Minor harm is not enough to break the hypnosis, only major trauma (enough to knock them unconscious) or supernatural intervention can shake them of it. %0a> -%3cCost: 1 Willpower + 1 Essence for every 10 targets%0a> -%3cDice Pool: Manipulation + Intimidation + Purity vs Resolve + Power Stat%0a> -%3cAction: Contested; resistance is reflexive%0a> -%3cDramatic Failure: The Gift fails completely, the Werewolf cannot use any Dominance Gifts for the rest of the scene.%0a> -%3cFailure: Subjects do not obey, but remain unaware of the supernatural nature of the order.%0a> -%3cSuccess: The subject follows the command as loyally as possible. They cannot attempt to twist the orders meaning or intent unless they pay a point of willpower (though those too dense or unskilled may still get it wrong), even then others will likely try to stop them. If faced with mortal danger, however, the subject may opt to delay their duties until safe.%0a> -%3cDramatic Success: For a week after the Gift ends the subject remains more pliable towards Dominance, they suffer a -1 penalty on all rolls to resist Dominance effects for the duration.%0a389,405c439,444%0a%3c !!!Stealth Gifts%0a%3c (:toggle hide hrstg:)%0a%3c >>id=hrstg%3c%3c%0a%3c Swap Running Shadow and Blending's dot ratings.

Strong winds blow away prints in the sand, leaves quickly cover his footfall. This effect permanently increases the difficulty to track the Werewolf, levying a -3 penalty on all such attempts. For even greater anonymity the Werewolf may reflexively spend a point of Essence, doing so removes all physical traces of his passage what-so-ever. He leaves no foot prints and has no lingering scent, he also reduces all environmental penalties to his movement by 2. Though, this application bears some extra risk; bystanders may think it odd to see a man striding atop a six foot snow drift without sinking, or blazing through hip deep sludge at full sprint.%0a%3c %0a%3c * Blending (ooo)%0a%3c Change: The user may move slowly, no more than slow walk, while the Gift is active, but Wits + Composure rolls made to spot him while he does so gain +3.%0a%3c %0a%3c * Shadow Flesh (ooooo)%0a%3c -%3cCost: 2 Essence%0a%3c -%3cDice Pool: Wits+Stealth+Cunning%0a---%0a> !!!Elemental Gifts%0a> (:toggle hide hreg:)%0a> >>id=hreg%3c%3c%0a> * Call/Alter Water (o)%0a> -%3cCost: None%0a> -%3cDice Pool: Wits + Survival + Glory%0a407,409c446,456%0a%3c -%3cSuccess: The character's body becomes a two-dimentional plane of shadow that lies flat against its surroundings. He has no scent, no texture, and makes no sounds save for those he chooses to emit. However he remains a physical entity, retains the ability to interact with the physical world, albeit at a -2 penalty, and may still be affected by opponents attacks. His form appears as normal (in whichever of his forms he currently takes), however the Uratha can twist his shape to resemble other shadows. Doing so requires a successful [Dexterity+Stealth] roll to contort his form, and even then his edges tend to waver.%0a%3c Being a shadow grants the Werewolf a +3 bonus to steath rolls, in inflcts a -3 penalty on all rolls to notice or attack him (In areas of particularly dim lighting the Werewolf is effectively invisible, save to those with supernaturally excellent senses). In addition to these bonuses he also gains a host of mobility options. He may scale walls and ceilings with no required roll, fit through slim and narrow openings, and never needs to roll to maintain his balance. Due to his complete two dimensionality the Werewolf is also immune to any attempts to grapple or restrain him physically.%0a%3c All clothing and personal possessions worn change along with the character, though large unwealdly objects are left behind. Fetishes and dedicated objects always change. This form lasts for ten minutes per success, or until the Werewolf elects to end the Gift.%0a---%0a> -%3cCupping his hands the Uratha conjures water from thin air. The "water" arrives in whatever molecular state the Werewolf chooses (Solid, Liquid, Gas), though it is then subject to the natural effects of the outside temperature. Steam is never hot enough to cause injury, and ice never cold enough to harm someone without prolonged exposure. Each roll creates one cup of water, that pours/drops/spreads outward from his palms. The water is not pressurized and cannot be directed.%0a> Alternatively, the Uratha may instead use this Gift to alter the chemical state of water in his surroundings. He can freeze, melt, and vaporize up to one cubic yard of water per success with a single touch. Once again, this doesn't allow him to make steam scolding hot, or ice improbably cold, nor can he shape the water in any special way outside of the ability to choose which sections change. Water that is inside a living creature is not a viable target for this effect, however the Uratha could easily freeze all the water on a wet man's skin, or melt a person sized hole in an ice cap.%0a> %0a> * Manipulate Earth (oo)%0a> Same, but he can sculpt 100 square feet (or 40 cubic) of earth per success. The user may also sculpt man made stone, like pavement and asphalt, but the amount each success can alter is halved (about 20 cubic feet of earth). The roll may also be penalized based on the pliability of the surface.%0a> %0a> * Command Fire (ooo)%0a> No change, but a clarification: This gift lasts [Success] actions, and generates roughly a large bonfire's worth of flame upon activation. The user may control and direct that flame and surrounding fires for the remainder of the duration.%0a> %0a> * Lament of the River (ooooo)%0a> The caster may select an epicenter up to 10 miles away from his location to be the nexus of the disaster. In the absence of natural water, manmade water sources will bulge instead. Pipes burst, sewers overflow, water towers explode. All water will pool violently into the selected area and continue to ravage it for the remainder of the scene. Areas with no water at all will still moisten visibly, though it is unlikely to do much damage.%0a412,419c459,479%0a%3c !!!Technology Gifts%0a%3c (:toggle hide hrtg:)%0a%3c >>id=hrtg%3c%3c%0a%3c -%3cSwap Machinegeist and Create Technology's dot ratings.%0a%3c %0a%3c * Left-Handed Spanner (o)%0a%3c -%3cCost: None%0a%3c -%3cDice Pool: Wits + Crafts + Purity%0a---%0a> !!!Evasion Gifts%0a> (:toggle hide hrevg:)%0a> >>id=hrevg%3c%3c%0a> Swap Sand in the Eyes and Playing Possum's dot rating.%0a> Playing Possum will also be a mind affect, otherwise a uratha goes prone and gets double-tapped in the head.

If they beat it, they resist the mind compulsion though the werewolf still seems dead. If not, the werewolf seems dead and there's no need to do anything more about them.%0a> %0a> * Sand in the Eyes (ooo)%0a> The Uratha blurs his presence in the world, taking on a spirit like aspect, though one that is next to impossible to notice. It allows him to tread unremembered and unrecorded, leaving little evidence of his passing in the minds of others. Even those with whom he interacts.

The difficulty of said roll is equal to the number of successes rolled on Left-Handed Spanner's activation roll. The interval of the action is decided by the storyteller based on the devices complexity, along with any bonus or penalties from the character's own expertise.%0a%3c %0a%3c * Create Technology (oooo)%0a%3c The MacGyvered device functions for the remainder of the scene, or until the Werewolf stops using it (whichever is longer). Only the devices creator may use it to its full effect, for everyone else it remains a hunk of useless scrap. (A gun hobbled together from scrap metal would cease to function at the end of a fight, while a scrap car given new life might endure a full day of driving before collapsing into a heap of rust and debris.)%0a%3c %0a%3c * Machinegeist (ooooo)%0a%3c In addition to all other effects of Machinegeist, the Uratha may control the machine completely, employing it to any of the functions for which it was designed. Mundane attempts to arrest control from him (such a steering the car, or slamming on the breaks) fail, though controlling magic enters roll off.%0a---%0a> -%3cThe werewolf releases a piercing howl, which echoes infinitely about the battlefield. With it he summons, chaos, discord and contempt. Communication and coordination collapse and chaos reigns within the field. For the remainder of the scene all attempts at communication more sophisticated than simple gestures and face-to-face discussion are automatically reduced to a chance die. Radio broadcasts come in garbled, phones lose all signal, computers fuzz up and misdisplay information, distant signs seem blurry, shouted orders fail to carry, even smoke signals are likely to be met with an unexpected wind. Communication bolstered by supernatural effects (such as an enchanted walkie-talkie, or telepathic communion) contest this effect normally, and regardless of result, the botch from the chance die cannot cause their effects to be dispelled (merely impeded for the time). %0a> The caster may choose to select individuals to be exempt from the effects of the Gift, though they must be present at the moment of invocation to do so.%0a429,443c484,504%0a%3c [[#hrcunningend]]%0a%3c [[#hrglory]]%0a%3c !!!Gibbous Moon Gifts%0a%3c (:toggle hide hrgmg:)%0a%3c >>id=hrgmg%3c%3c%0a%3c * Pack Awareness (o)%0a%3c The a character can only benefit from the willpower bonus from an exceptional success once per scene.%0a%3c %0a%3c * Resist Pain (oo)%0a%3c -%3cCost: 1 Essence%0a%3c -%3cResist Pain may be given to pack mates with an inspirational word.

Beings, objects, locations, all fair game. The scents are nonspecific but generally give a sense of the nature of the magic and vague descriptor (person, place, or thing). Scent of Taint does not reveal the source of a magical effect, it merely makes it possible to seek out magic based on its supernatural nature alone. The Werewolf must still roll Wits + Composure to spot a supernatural entity, and hidden people/objects/locations are not automatically revealed. (Note: For the more rules obsessed, a magical occlusion effect, like invisibility or a ward, is itself considered to be occluded).

Additionally this calm spreads to other within the zone, all other Uratha (and supernaturals with a similar tendency to go berserk) gain +1 to resist Deathrage (Torment, Frenzy etc.), pack mates gain +3 instead, and all rolls made to inspire hostility, fear, or hatred are made at a -2 penalty.%0a%3c %0a%3c * Shadow Ward (oooo)%0a%3c -%3cCost: 2 Essence (+1 Essence)%0a%3c -%3cDice Pool: Inteligence+Occult+Honor%0a%3c -%3cAction: Extended (Variable Successes, One hour per Roll)%0a%3c -%3cChange: Each successful roll increases the penalty for crossing or seeing through the Gauntlet by one. The Werewolf may continue to reinforce the shadow for up to [Honor] hours. The difficulty of each roll varies depending on the location, generally ranging from 1 for simple rifts, to 5 for powerful Loci. Repeat invocations of this Gift do not stack, the most powerful casting takes precedence. While the effect lasts only one Lunar Cycle, it may be renewed by repaying the Gift's cost and meditating at the location for a single hour, no roll required. The renewer of the Ward need not be the original caster.%0a%3c For an additional point of Essence while enacting the Ward the Uratha may added exceptions, loopholes in the veil that allow certain beings easier passage. Sample exceptions include: "Is a member of the creators pack", "serves the Lodge of Black Arrows", or "Carries a key of pure gold". The exceptions themselves have no intelligence, nor can they read the motivations of others, so "Will be helpful" and "Means the pack no harm" are not viable conditions. Up to [Honor] exceptions may be placed when the ward is created, and once placed they may not be altered without first removing (or replacing) the previous ward.%0a%3c %0a%3c * Ward of Spirit Slumber (ooooo)%0a%3c Change: Duration is now one minute per success. While activating the Ward he may specify nearby allies to be immune to the effect, by default all pack mates and their totem are excluded from the wards effects.

All liquid that would reasonably freeze does so immediately, surfaces frost up, rain becomes hail. Living creatures suffer worst of all, for every action spent within the freezing field they must succeed a reflexive [Stamina] roll or take two points of bashing damage. Creatures particularly vulnerable to freezing (such as sealife) take lethal damage instead, while creatures immune (Undead, Cold Spirits, Automata, etc) do not suffer. In addition, everyone in the area vulnerable to cold takes a -2 penalty to all strength and dexterity related rolls. At storyteller discresion heavy clothing and proper (or improper) preparation may add to or penalize the resistance roll.%0a%3c This field lasts for one turn per success on the activation roll. The caster may choose while activating this gift to attune a number of allies to the cold, immunitizing them to the Gifts effects. By default all packmates and their totem are naturally attuned. Multiple activations of this Gift do not stack, even if different characters are using it.%0a%3c -%3cDramatic Success: the cold is so severe it deals lethal three points of bashing damage instead of two.%0a%3c %0a%3c * Thunderbolt (ooooo)%0a%3c -%3cCost: 2 Essence%0a%3c -%3cDice Pool: Manipulation+Survival+Honor - Stamina%0a%3c -%3cAction: Instant%0a%3c -%3cSuccess: The bolt deals two lethal damage per success.

Spirit Rank does not prevent the Gifts effects, but can add to or penalize the roll.

Attempts to exert any kind of authority (including through Dominance Gifts) are at a -3 for the rest of the scene.%0a%3c -%3cFailure: Nothing happens%0a%3c Success: The subject(s) with which the Uratha interacts see him or her as their direct superior. This isn't a literal illusion, the Werewolf does not appear to be a different person, but something about his presence indicates to the subject that he has authority over them. If they are a member of some group or organization they mistake the Uratha for a superior within that hierarchy (if they are a member of several organization they will apply the most sensible one), otherwise they view the Werewolf as a sort of big brother, authority figure. Subjects take -2 to any action intended to oppose the Werewolf's authority and, more importantly, will generally follow his orders and grant him access into relevant locations and information pertinent to the organization. Though, the Storyteller may require an the Werewolf to make a Manipulation+Subturfuge roll to justify why he'd need access, if the information is sensitive enough.%0a%3c -%3cDramatic Success: The Werewolf never needs to roll to justify their need, the victim simply assumes they MUST have a reason.%0a%3c %0a%3c * Tug the Soul's Strings (ooooo)%0a%3c The Werewolf learns to apply the principles of dominance to groups and congregations, acting with authority over many as opposed to over one. This functions much like Luna's Dictum, but on a much larger scale. The Werewolf applies the command not to a single individual, but to everyone within earshot (up to [(Purity or Primal Urge)+Successes+Extra Essence]*10 individuals) for one hour per success. Supernatural entities and meaningful NPCs resist individually, but it is advised that background characters be lumped together when rolling.%0a%3c Like Luna's Dictum this Gift cannot cause people to perform actions that are deeply against their moral code, or clearly harmful to their wellbeing, but otherwise any order is fair game. Unlike Luna's Dictum, the sheer magnitude of people obeying quells rebellion. Subjects cannot twist the meaning of the command unless they spend a point of willpower, and will actively attempt to stop those who are trying to sabotage the order. Minor harm is not enough to break the hypnosis, only major trauma (enough to knock them unconscious) or supernatural intervention can shake them of it. %0a%3c -%3cCost: 1 Willpower + 1 Essence for every 10 targets%0a%3c -%3cDice Pool: Manipulation + Intimidation + Purity vs Resolve + Power Stat%0a%3c -%3cAction: Contested; resistance is reflexive%0a%3c -%3cDramatic Failure: The Gift fails completely, the Werewolf cannot use any Dominance Gifts for the rest of the scene.%0a%3c -%3cFailure: Subjects do not obey, but remain unaware of the supernatural nature of the order.%0a%3c -%3cSuccess: The subject follows the command as loyally as possible. They cannot attempt to twist the orders meaning or intent unless they pay a point of willpower (though those too dense or unskilled may still get it wrong), even then others will likely try to stop them. If faced with mortal danger, however, the subject may opt to delay their duties until safe.%0a%3c -%3cDramatic Success: For a week after the Gift ends the subject remains more pliable towards Dominance, they suffer a -1 penalty on all rolls to resist Dominance effects for the duration.%0a---%0a> %0a> !!!Knowledge Gifts%0a> (:toggle hide hrkg:)%0a> >>id=hrkg%3c%3c%0a> * Traveler's Blessing (oo)%0a> -%3cDuration: [Success] Hours%0a> %0a> * Know the Path (oooo)%0a> -%3cChange: When a location has multiple inhabitants use the highest of their Resolve + Power Stat to resist.

Using this Gift a Werewolf can spread wounds and damage across their body, repositioning them to less critical locations and generally dispersing the harm. A bloody gash across the neck might be broken into a dozen smaller cuts on the arms and legs, a gaping hole in the chest might be shifted to bloody lacerations across the back. %0a> This gift cannot be used to regenerate a crippling wound, a missing eye or leg cannot be restored.

The wounds are downgraded at one point per action, for [Success] actions, starting on the action in which this Gift is activated. While active the Werewolf may take actions as normal, but suffers a -2 penalty to all physical rolls due to the shifting of his form.

The "water" arrives in whatever molecular state the Werewolf chooses (Solid, Liquid, Gas), though it is then subject to the natural effects of the outside temperature. Steam is never hot enough to cause injury, and ice never cold enough to harm someone without prolonged exposure. Each roll creates one cup of water, that pours/drops/spreads outward from his palms. The water is not pressurized and cannot be directed.%0a%3c Alternatively, the Uratha may instead use this Gift to alter the chemical state of water in his surroundings. He can freeze, melt, and vaporize up to one cubic yard of water per success with a single touch. Once again, this doesn't allow him to make steam scolding hot, or ice improbably cold, nor can he shape the water in any special way outside of the ability to choose which sections change. Water that is inside a living creature is not a viable target for this effect, however the Uratha could easily freeze all the water on a wet man's skin, or melt a person sized hole in an ice cap.%0a%3c %0a%3c * Manipulate Earth (oo)%0a%3c Same, but he can sculpt 100 square feet (or 40 cubic) of earth per success. The user may also sculpt man made stone, like pavement and asphalt, but the amount each success can alter is halved (about 20 cubic feet of earth). The roll may also be penalized based on the pliability of the surface.%0a%3c %0a%3c * Command Fire (ooo)%0a%3c No change, but a clarification: This gift lasts [Success] actions, and generates roughly a large bonfire's worth of flame upon activation. The user may control and direct that flame and surrounding fires for the remainder of the duration.%0a%3c %0a%3c * Lament of the River (ooooo)%0a%3c The caster may select an epicenter up to 10 miles away from his location to be the nexus of the disaster. In the absence of natural water, manmade water sources will bulge instead. Pipes burst, sewers overflow, water towers explode. All water will pool violently into the selected area and continue to ravage it for the remainder of the scene. Areas with no water at all will still moisten visibly, though it is unlikely to do much damage.%0a---%0a> Same, but change: Primal Form is an enhancement to Gauru and consumes Gauru turns at the same rate. If the Werewolf enters Death Rage while in Primal Form (very likely), he remains in Primal Form for the duration. If a werewolf enters Death Rage outside for Primal Form, he may reflexively activate Primal Form (assuming he can pay the cost).%0a622,634c653,659%0a%3c !!!Full Moon Gifts%0a%3c (:toggle hide hrfmg:)%0a%3c >>id=hrfmg%3c%3c%0a%3c * Clarity (o)%0a%3c When a Rahu activates this Gift he may also reflexively shift into Gauru form at no extra cost.

Scent of Taint does not reveal the source of a magical effect, it merely makes it possible to seek out magic based on its supernatural nature alone. The Werewolf must still roll Wits + Composure to spot a supernatural entity, and hidden people/objects/locations are not automatically revealed. (Note: For the more rules obsessed, a magical occlusion effect, like invisibility or a ward, is itself considered to be occluded). (Note: The Gift user must defeat the initial activation roll of a power or effect that supernaturally conceals its user.

This may be as vague as "Coming Danger" or as specific as "My Best Friends Moment of Death". They proceed to fall into a long trace, during which they may take no action and are totally unaware of the outside world. Only extreme trauma, such as violent shaking or receiving damage, can shake them from this trance.%0a%3c Alternatively, they may opt to remain unspecific in which case the Storyteller is encouraged to provide them with disjointed and cryptic visions of critical challenges yet to come.

If the Werewolf is seeking for a particular event or omen the visions will generally revolve around it, showing different aspects leading up to and resulting from the event. Otherwise it will show the Uratha tidbits of random, but meaningful events in their life. These visions are not restricted to future portent alone. When relevant Omen Gazing will show snapshots of past and even current events.%0a%3c -%3cDramatic Success: The vision focuses very specifically on the key components of one event, notably those that conspire to bring about that particular future, and how it may be averted.%0a---%0a> The Werewolf calls upon the tiny spirit of an object, bolstering it with essence and renewing it in purpose. Each success on the activation roll adds 1 point to the object's durability for the remainder of the scene. This does not in any way repair a damaged object, nor can it grant use to an object that has been completely ruined (though he might still be able to use a reinforced object for unintended function, like bashing things). At the end of the scene the durability fades, damaged suffered does not. In many cases this can cause the object to collapse.%0a> %0a> * Condense or Expand (ooooo)%0a> Same effect, but: Objects shrunk do not become more durable, and those enlarged do not become less so.%0a753,768c718,738%0a%3c !!!Knowledge Gifts%0a%3c (:toggle hide hrkg:)%0a%3c >>id=hrkg%3c%3c%0a%3c * Traveler's Blessing (oo)%0a%3c -%3cDuration: [Success] Hours%0a%3c %0a%3c * Know the Path (oooo)%0a%3c -%3cChange: When a location has multiple inhabitants use the highest of their Resolve + Power Stat to resist.

Strong winds blow away prints in the sand, leaves quickly cover his footfall. This effect permanently increases the difficulty to track the Werewolf, levying a -3 penalty on all such attempts. For even greater anonymity the Werewolf may reflexively spend a point of Essence, doing so removes all physical traces of his passage what-so-ever. He leaves no foot prints and has no lingering scent, he also reduces all environmental penalties to his movement by 2. Though, this application bears some extra risk; bystanders may think it odd to see a man striding atop a six foot snow drift without sinking, or blazing through hip deep sludge at full sprint.%0a> %0a> * Blending (ooo)%0a> Change: The user may move slowly, no more than slow walk, while the Gift is active, but Wits + Composure rolls made to spot him while he does so gain +3.%0a> %0a> * Shadow Flesh (ooooo)%0a> -%3cCost: 2 Essence%0a> -%3cDice Pool: Wits+Stealth+Cunning%0a> -%3cAction: Instant%0a> -%3cSuccess: The character's body becomes a two-dimentional plane of shadow that lies flat against its surroundings. He has no scent, no texture, and makes no sounds save for those he chooses to emit. However he remains a physical entity, retains the ability to interact with the physical world, albeit at a -2 penalty, and may still be affected by opponents attacks. His form appears as normal (in whichever of his forms he currently takes), however the Uratha can twist his shape to resemble other shadows. Doing so requires a successful [Dexterity+Stealth] roll to contort his form, and even then his edges tend to waver.%0a> Being a shadow grants the Werewolf a +3 bonus to steath rolls, in inflcts a -3 penalty on all rolls to notice or attack him (In areas of particularly dim lighting the Werewolf is effectively invisible, save to those with supernaturally excellent senses). In addition to these bonuses he also gains a host of mobility options. He may scale walls and ceilings with no required roll, fit through slim and narrow openings, and never needs to roll to maintain his balance. Due to his complete two dimensionality the Werewolf is also immune to any attempts to grapple or restrain him physically.%0a> All clothing and personal possessions worn change along with the character, though large unwealdly objects are left behind.

All foes who hear it are immediately subject to the full effects of Lunacy. Including supernatural creatures, such as spirits and Uratha who are not normally subject to this effect.

Only the devices creator may use it to its full effect, for everyone else it remains a hunk of useless scrap.

Using this Gift a Werewolf can spread wounds and damage across their body, repositioning them to less critical locations and generally dispersing the harm. A bloody gash across the neck might be broken into a dozen smaller cuts on the arms and legs, a gaping hole in the chest might be shifted to bloody lacerations across the back. %0a%3c This gift cannot be used to regenerate a crippling wound, a missing eye or leg cannot be restored.

A single Aggravated wound is becomes two lethal wounds, and a single lethal wound is downgraded to two bashing. The wounds are downgraded at one point per action, for [Success] actions, starting on the action in which this Gift is activated. While active the Werewolf may take actions as normal, but suffers a -2 penalty to all physical rolls due to the shifting of his form. Only one instance of this effect may be active at any one time.%0a%3c %0a%3c * Primal Form (ooooo)%0a%3c -%3cCost: 1 Essence and 1 willpower%0a%3c -%3cDice Pool: This power requires no roll%0a%3c -%3cAction: Instant%0a%3c Same, but change: Primal Form is an enhancement to Gauru and consumes Gauru turns at the same rate. If the Werewolf enters Death Rage while in Primal Form (very likely), he remains in Primal Form for the duration. If a werewolf enters Death Rage outside for Primal Form, he may reflexively activate Primal Form (assuming he can pay the cost).%0a---%0a> !!!Warding Gifts%0a> (:toggle hide hrwg:)%0a> >>id=hrwg%3c%3c%0a> -%3cWard Against Humans is now one dot.

Given the way the ward is constructed, natural predators tend to stay away as well. They can tell that it is the territory of a superior beast.%0a> %0a> * Ward Against Rage (oo)%0a> One of the simplest precautions a Werewolf can take to secure their territory is to defend it against his own rage, and that of others. %0a> -%3cCost: None%0a> -%3cDice Pool: Composure + Persuasion + Honor%0a> -%3cAction: Extended (5 Successes per square mile required; one hour per roll)%0a> The Werewolf ritually walks the boundaries of her territory (a maximum area equal to one square mile per point of the character's Primal Urge). She takes the time to familiarize herself with the objects and places within, and show their spirits she means no harm. This act brings an unnatural tranquility to the zone. Add +3 to any rolls by the character to resist Death Rage within her territory. Additionally this calm spreads to other within the zone, all other Uratha (and supernaturals with a similar tendency to go berserk) gain +1 to resist Deathrage (Torment, Frenzy etc.), pack mates gain +3 instead, and all rolls made to inspire hostility, fear, or hatred are made at a -2 penalty.%0a> %0a> * Shadow Ward (oooo)%0a> -%3cCost: 2 Essence (+1 Essence)%0a> -%3cDice Pool: Inteligence+Occult+Honor%0a> -%3cAction: Extended (Variable Successes, One hour per Roll)%0a> -%3cChange: Each successful roll increases the penalty for crossing or seeing through the Gauntlet by one. The Werewolf may continue to reinforce the shadow for up to [Honor] hours. The difficulty of each roll varies depending on the location, generally ranging from 1 for simple rifts, to 5 for powerful Loci. Repeat invocations of this Gift do not stack, the most powerful casting takes precedence. While the effect lasts only one Lunar Cycle, it may be renewed by repaying the Gift's cost and meditating at the location for a single hour, no roll required. The renewer of the Ward need not be the original caster.%0a> For an additional point of Essence while enacting the Ward the Uratha may added exceptions, loopholes in the veil that allow certain beings easier passage. Sample exceptions include: "Is a member of the creators pack", "serves the Lodge of Black Arrows", or "Carries a key of pure gold". The exceptions themselves have no intelligence, nor can they read the motivations of others, so "Will be helpful" and "Means the pack no harm" are not viable conditions. Up to [Honor] exceptions may be placed when the ward is created, and once placed they may not be altered without first removing (or replacing) the previous ward.%0a> %0a> * Ward of Spirit Slumber (ooooo)%0a> Change: Duration is now one minute per success. While activating the Ward he may specify nearby allies to be immune to the effect, by default all pack mates and their totem are excluded from the wards effects. The Werewolf may use this Gift as many times per day as he likes, but a Spirit need only resist it once to be immune for the next 24 hours.%0a811c787,808%0a%3c [[#hrpuend]]%0a\ No newline at end of file%0a---%0a> %0a> !!!Weather Gifts%0a> (:toggle hide hrweg:)%0a> >>id=hrweg%3c%3c%0a> * Silent Fog (oo)%0a> -%3cCost: None%0a> %0a> * Killing Frost (oooo)%0a> -%3cCost: 1 Essence%0a> -%3cDice Pool: Manipulation+Survival+Honor%0a> -%3cAction: Instant%0a> Success: The temperature surrounding the Werewolf suddenly plunges, dropping to sub zero within 10 yards per dot of Honor (Or Primal Urge, whichever is higher). All liquid that would reasonably freeze does so immediately, surfaces frost up, rain becomes hail. Living creatures suffer worst of all, for every action spent within the freezing field they must succeed a reflexive [Stamina] roll or take two points of bashing damage. Creatures particularly vulnerable to freezing (such as sealife) take lethal damage instead, while creatures immune (Undead, Cold Spirits, Automata, etc) do not suffer. In addition, everyone in the area vulnerable to cold takes a -2 penalty to all strength and dexterity related rolls. At storyteller discresion heavy clothing and proper (or improper) preparation may add to or penalize the resistance roll.%0a> This field lasts for one turn per success on the activation roll. The caster may choose while activating this gift to attune a number of allies to the cold, immunitizing them to the Gifts effects. By default all packmates and their totem are naturally attuned.

The family crest, a wolf's head carrying a ring in its mouth, is reflected in much of the estate's architecture and design. There are three wings to the manor, offering an abundance of rooms for visiting members of the family or guests. The grounds of the estate lie close to the nearby swamps of Skidrow Island, casting a dark feeling upon the building and its inhabitants.%0a---%0a> The meeting ground of the Forsaken in Savannah is a copse of trees, grown in a circle, on a patch of raised ground. This piece of pristine wilderness is where the packs come together to interact and create ever shifting allegiances. There is a central bonfire that is lit at night to provide illumination, and werewolf Gifts have hollowed out the ground beneath the meeting spot, creating a council chamber where the packs' leaders and representatives can meet privately to discuss policy and future actions.%0a> %0a> This meeting chamber is a vast underground room, fortified by the living roots of the trees above. There exists in the central chamber a table, crafted from a still living tree, and a seat for every representative of each pack that claims membership in the Hegemony.%0a> %0a> It is rumored that sometimes spirits or stranger entities come calling on the werewolves for their own reasons, offering promises and favors in exchange for support in their own causes.%0a> %0a> !!Loci%0a> %0a> The Hegemony maintains several powerful loci, made possible only by the combined might of the packs aligned underneath the Alpha pack. This organization is rarely found among the Forsaken packs, but it has offered undeniable benefits:%0a> %0a> * Werewolves who are members of the Hegemony have an easier time accessing Essence to fuel their powers. They gain one Essence point per day, but may me rewarded with more for acting in service to the Hegemony.%0a> %0a> * Werewolves have access to the Shadow from any of the loci that dot the wilderness. The spirit wilds are "relatively" tame here and not as dangerous to traverse until you're one mile away from Hegemony territory.%0a> %0a> * Werewolves receive +1 to resist Death Rage and teamwork rolls while visiting the Tur. The use of Inspiration Gifts is periodically carried out to promote an atmosphere of cooperation and reduce the strain on a visiting werewolf's instincts.%0a> %0a> !!Wards & Guardians%0a> %0a> This is the center of Forsaken power in Savannah. The collective efforts of the packs underneath the Lords of Mourning Glory have yielded mighty protections. These protections are to maintain the security of the protectorate as much as keep its prisoners inside. There have been several incidents of attempted release of the totems locked inside their "cells" by the Pure Tribes.%0a> %0a> * Ward vs Humans / Bind Human: Any human (including Mages, Ghouls, Wolf-Blooded, and Sleepwalkers) attempting to enter into the wilderness feel a sensation of powerful foreboding that prevents entry.

This bonus does not apply vs targets that have no spirit rank.%0a%3c %0a%3c * Warning Growl (o)%0a%3c -%3cCost: 1 Willpower%0a%3c -%3cAction: Reflexsive; Roll Pres + Intimidation + Honor versus Composure + Power Stat%0a%3c Success: Warning Growl inflicts the target with a preternatural weariness where the Werewolf is concerned. He takes a -2 penalty to all rolls made to ''physically'' oppose or harm the Uratha for the remainder of the scene.%0a%3c -%3cDramatic Success: The penalty increases to -3%0a%3c %0a%3c * Luna's Dictum (oo)%0a%3c -%3cCost: 1 Essence%0a%3c -%3cChange: Make the duration 30 minutes per success. Additionally the subject only refuses an order if it is obviously dangerous or against their moral code.%0a%3c %0a%3c * Voice of Command (ooo) [Rewrite]%0a%3c The Werewolf learns to carry themself with an air of utmost authority. This Gift activates automatically but is contested individually by those with whom the Werewolf interacts. %0a%3c -%3cCost: 1 Essence%0a%3c -%3cDice Pool: Presence + Intimidation + Purity vs Resolve + Power Stat%0a%3c -%3cAction: Instant, then Contested (resistance is reflexive)%0a%3c Dramatic Failure: The Gift inverts itself, all present see the Uratha as utterly below them. Attempts to exert any kind of authority (including through Dominance Gifts) are at a -3 for the rest of the scene.%0a%3c -%3cFailure: Nothing happens%0a%3c Success: The subject(s) with which the Uratha interacts see him or her as their direct superior. This isn't a literal illusion, the Werewolf does not appear to be a different person, but something about his presence indicates to the subject that he has authority over them. If they are a member of some group or organization they mistake the Uratha for a superior within that hierarchy (if they are a member of several organization they will apply the most sensible one), otherwise they view the Werewolf as a sort of big brother, authority figure. Subjects take -2 to any action intended to oppose the Werewolf's authority and, more importantly, will generally follow his orders and grant him access into relevant locations and information pertinent to the organization. Though, the Storyteller may require an the Werewolf to make a Manipulation+Subturfuge roll to justify why he'd need access, if the information is sensitive enough.%0a%3c -%3cDramatic Success: The Werewolf never needs to roll to justify their need, the victim simply assumes they MUST have a reason.%0a%3c %0a%3c * Tug the Soul's Strings (ooooo)%0a%3c The Werewolf learns to apply the principles of dominance to groups and congregations, acting with authority over many as opposed to over one. This functions much like Luna's Dictum, but on a much larger scale. The Werewolf applies the command not to a single individual, but to everyone within earshot (up to [(Purity or Primal Urge)+Successes+Extra Essence]*10 individuals) for one hour per success. Supernatural entities and meaningful NPCs resist individually, but it is advised that background characters be lumped together when rolling.%0a%3c Like Luna's Dictum this Gift cannot cause people to perform actions that are deeply against their moral code, or clearly harmful to their wellbeing, but otherwise any order is fair game. Unlike Luna's Dictum, the sheer magnitude of people obeying quells rebellion. Subjects cannot twist the meaning of the command unless they spend a point of willpower, and will actively attempt to stop those who are trying to sabotage the order. Minor harm is not enough to break the hypnosis, only major trauma (enough to knock them unconscious) or supernatural intervention can shake them of it. %0a%3c -%3cCost: 1 Willpower + 1 Essence for every 10 targets%0a%3c -%3cDice Pool: Manipulation + Intimidation + Purity vs Resolve + Power Stat%0a%3c -%3cAction: Contested; resistance is reflexive%0a%3c -%3cDramatic Failure: The Gift fails completely, the Werewolf cannot use any Dominance Gifts for the rest of the scene.%0a%3c -%3cFailure: Subjects do not obey, but remain unaware of the supernatural nature of the order.%0a%3c -%3cSuccess: The subject follows the command as loyally as possible. They cannot attempt to twist the orders meaning or intent unless they pay a point of willpower (though those too dense or unskilled may still get it wrong), even then others will likely try to stop them. If faced with mortal danger, however, the subject may opt to delay their duties until safe.%0a%3c -%3cDramatic Success: For a week after the Gift ends the subject remains more pliable towards Dominance, they suffer a -1 penalty on all rolls to resist Dominance effects for the duration.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!Elemental Gifts%0a%3c %0a%3c * Call/Alter Water (o)%0a%3c -%3cCost: None%0a%3c -%3cDice Pool: Wits + Survival + Glory%0a%3c -%3cAction: Instant%0a%3c -%3cCupping his hands the Uratha conjures water from thin air. The "water" arrives in whatever molecular state the Werewolf chooses (Solid, Liquid, Gas), though it is then subject to the natural effects of the outside temperature. Steam is never hot enough to cause injury, and ice never cold enough to harm someone without prolonged exposure. Each roll creates one cup of water, that pours/drops/spreads outward from his palms. The water is not pressurized and cannot be directed.%0a%3c Alternatively, the Uratha may instead use this Gift to alter the chemical state of water in his surroundings. He can freeze, melt, and vaporize up to one cubic yard of water per success with a single touch. Once again, this doesn't allow him to make steam scolding hot, or ice improbably cold, nor can he shape the water in any special way outside of the ability to choose which sections change. Water that is inside a living creature is not a viable target for this effect, however the Uratha could easily freeze all the water on a wet man's skin, or melt a person sized hole in an ice cap.%0a%3c %0a%3c * Manipulate Earth (oo)%0a%3c Same, but he can sculpt 100 square feet (or 40 cubic) of earth per success. The user may also sculpt man made stone, like pavement and asphalt, but the amount each success can alter is halved (about 20 cubic feet of earth). The roll may also be penalized based on the pliability of the surface.%0a%3c %0a%3c * Command Fire (ooo)%0a%3c No change, but a clarification: This gift lasts [Success] actions, and generates roughly a large bonfire's worth of flame upon activation. The user may control and direct that flame and surrounding fires for the remainder of the duration.%0a%3c %0a%3c * Lament of the River (ooooo)%0a%3c The caster may select an epicenter up to 10 miles away from his location to be the nexus of the disaster. In the absence of natural water, manmade water sources will bulge instead. Pipes burst, sewers overflow, water towers explode. All water will pool violently into the selected area and continue to ravage it for the remainder of the scene. Areas with no water at all will still moisten visibly, though it is unlikely to do much damage.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!Evasion Gifts%0a%3c %0a%3c Swap Sand in the Eyes and Playing Possum's dot rating.%0a%3c Playing Possum will also be a mind affect, otherwise a uratha goes prone and gets double-tapped in the head. Gifts, powers, arcana which would invoke a clash roll (Resolve + Stealth + Cunning) or heighten ones senses such as reading auras compare their successes to those used in activating Playing Possum. If they beat it, they resist the mind compulsion though the werewolf still seems dead. If not, the werewolf seems dead and there's no need to do anything more about them.%0a%3c %0a%3c * Sand in the Eyes (ooo)%0a%3c The Uratha blurs his presence in the world, taking on a spirit like aspect, though one that is next to impossible to notice. It allows him to tread unremembered and unrecorded, leaving little evidence of his passing in the minds of others. Even those with whom he interacts. This effect endures for the entire scene and effects only attempt to remember the Werewolf's actions and presence within that scene.%0a%3c -%3cCost: 1 Essence%0a%3c -%3cDice Pool: Same%0a%3c -%3cAction: Instant, then Contested%0a%3c -%3cDramatic Failure: The effect backfires, everyone gains +5 to remember the Werewolf and details about him.%0a%3c -%3cFailure: Memory is not clouded%0a%3c -%3cSuccess: Everyone who sees the Werewolf while he is under the effects of the Gift take a -5 penalty to remember any details about him from the scene. Even technology seems to suffer, camera footage comes out blurred and security records seem to have gaping holes for the time during which he was present. The user may elect to exempt up to [Cunning] allies from the effects of Sand in the Eyes, by default all packmates are also exempted (doesn't count towards the total).%0a%3c -%3cDramatic Success: The affected must make an Intelligence + Composure roll at -5 to remember he was there at all, all electronic records are erased completely.%0a%3c %0a%3c * Double Back (oooo)%0a%3c Same effect but the Gift compares its successes against those of mystical effects, if the Werewolf rolls better those effects are trumped.%0a%3c Fog of War (ooooo)%0a%3c -%3cCost: 1 Essence%0a%3c -%3cDice Pool: Presence + Expression + Cunning%0a%3c -%3cAction: Instant%0a%3c -%3cThe werewolf releases a piercing howl, which echoes infinitely about the battlefield. With it he summons, chaos, discord and contempt. Communication and coordination collapse and chaos reigns within the field. For the remainder of the scene all attempts at communication more sophisticated than simple gestures and face-to-face discussion are automatically reduced to a chance die. Radio broadcasts come in garbled, phones lose all signal, computers fuzz up and misdisplay information, distant signs seem blurry, shouted orders fail to carry, even smoke signals are likely to be met with an unexpected wind. Communication bolstered by supernatural effects (such as an enchanted walkie-talkie, or telepathic communion) contest this effect normally, and regardless of result, the botch from the chance die cannot cause their effects to be dispelled (merely impeded for the time). %0a%3c The caster may choose to select individuals to be exempt from the effects of the Gift, though they must be present at the moment of invocation to do so.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!Father Wolf Gifts%0a%3c %0a%3c * Wolf-Blood's Lure (o)%0a%3c In addition to all other effects, the Uratha adds +3 to all rolls to tame, train, and command wolves, dogs, and their relative species.%0a%3c %0a%3c * Father Wolf's Speed (oo)%0a%3c -%3cChange: Father Wolf's Speed adds +5 to the character's speed in Hishu and Dalu form.%0a%3c %0a%3c * Primal Howl (ooo)%0a%3c Primal Howl may only effect a target once per scene. Regardless of success or failure subsequent invocations will have no effect. Allies who hear the howl are unaffected, assuming they know for certain that the mighty Werebeast is on their side.%0a%3c -%3cDice Pool: Presence + Expression + Primal Urge vs Composure + Power Stat%0a%3c -%3cDramatic Failure: The Howl is so weak that it grants the Uratha's foes confidence. They gain +1 vs Lunacy and all rolls to resist being frightened or intimidated by the user.%0a%3c -%3cFailure: Nothing Happens.%0a%3c -%3cSuccess: The Howl terrifies listeners to the bones. All foes who hear it are immediately subject to the full effects of Lunacy. Including supernatural creatures, such as spirits and Uratha who are not normally subject to this effect. High ranking spirits possess additional resistance to this effect, add the difference between the Spirit and the Uratha's effective Rank in successes to the Spirit's resistance roll (assuming the Spirit's Rank is higher).%0a%3c -%3cDramatic Success: The fear sticks with them, add +1 to all attempts by the user to intimidate or frighten those effected by Primal Howl. This lasts for one week after the gifts activation.%0a%3c %0a%3c * Spirit Pack (ooooo)%0a%3c -%3cCost: 1 Essence and 1 Willpower%0a%3c -%3cClarification: The Werewolf can never have more than [Primal Urge+2] Wolf-Brothers summoned at one time. The spirits return to the shadow once their hunt has ended. This can cause them to endure for several scenes of hunt and pursuit. The Storyteller is the final arbiter of when enemies have been sufficiently dispatched to satisfy the pack, but they certainly don't vanish while adversaries remain in sight.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!Full Moon Gifts%0a%3c %0a%3c * Clarity (o)%0a%3c When a Rahu activates this Gift he may also reflexively shift into Gauru form at no extra cost. He must, however, succeed a shapeshifting roll to do so. This bonus lasts the entire scene.%0a%3c %0a%3c * Attunement%0a%3c Change: functions as normal but negates 1 point of defense per success, not 1 point per 2 successes.%0a%3c %0a%3c * Death Grip (ooo)%0a%3c We use the errata on this one; Death Grip grants a +6 bonus to overpower rolls in a grapple when in Urshul and Urhan form at 1 essence per bite, and the subject suffers an additional -2 to resist the grapple. Successes are not doubled.%0a%3c %0a%3c * Rage Armor (oooo)%0a%3c -%3cCost: 1 Essence%0a%3c -%3cDice Pool: Not rolled%0a%3c -%3cAction: Instant%0a%3c The werewolf gains points of armor equal to the higher of their Purity or Primal Urge (Max 5). This armor applies equally vs standard weapons and firearms, and stacks with worn armor and armor gained from assumed forms, but not armor provided by supernatural means. Rage Armor is not bulletproof, but is unaffected by armor piercing. When the Werewolf Shifts into Gauru form he may substitute 1 willpower for the essence cost of Rage Armor and activate the power reflexively. Rage Armor is scene long.%0a%3c %0a%3c * Luna's Fury (ooooo) %0a%3c -%3cCost: 1 Essence (+1 Essence every turn)%0a%3c -%3cDice Pool: Dexterity + Brawl + Purity%0a%3c -%3cAction: Reflexive%0a%3c -%3cSuccess: For a number of turns per successes rolled; the werewolf must spend one essence per turn (this is not an option, they have to spend it) in exchange the Werewolf may make all-out-attacks without losing his defense, applies his defense vs Firearms, doubles it against all other incoming attacks, and is not penalized by the number of opponents. This defense bonus even applies in Gauru Death Rage, allowing the Werewolf to continue to dodge while in the throes of pure fury. The werewolf may not opt to prematurely and the gift unless they've run completely out of Essence.%0a%3c -%3cDramatic Success: The werewolf may end the effects of the gift any time he wants. Doing so causes the Essence loss to cease.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!Gibbous Moon Gifts%0a%3c %0a%3c * Pack Awareness (o)%0a%3c The a character can only benefit from the willpower bonus from an exceptional success once per scene.%0a%3c %0a%3c * Resist Pain (oo)%0a%3c -%3cCost: 1 Essence%0a%3c -%3cResist Pain may be given to pack mates with an inspirational word. For those connected mentally, this inspiration may be given across that link. Using the Gift this way costs 1 Essence instead of 1 Willpower.%0a%3c -%3cDramatic Success: The beneficiary of the Gift automatically succeeds the first roll to remain conscious if their health levels are filled with bashing.%0a%3c %0a%3c * Call of Glory (ooooo)%0a%3c Remove the shared pack totem requirement, Call of Glory may heal up to [Glory+Successes] allies within earshot. Add: "A character can only benefit from Call of Glory once per day, it does not matter if the Gift is being used by a different Uratha, once per day is the limit."%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!Half Moon Gifts%0a%3c %0a%3c * Scent Beneath the Surface (o)%0a%3c -%3cDramatic Success: The Elodoth's senses are so keen that he can discern exact detail from omission alone. The player gains one clue as the their targets motivation.%0a%3c %0a%3c *Snarl of Command (oo)%0a%3c -%3cCost: 1 Essence%0a%3c -%3cDice Pool: Same%0a%3c -%3cAction: Same%0a%3c -%3cEffects are unchanged save that the Werewolf may challenge (Honor) lies per activation. The lies must all be answered in succession, so it is advised the werewolf let the victim weave their nest of untruths before breaking it.%0a%3c %0a%3c * Aura of Truce (ooo)%0a%3c -%3cSame but add: If a member takes hostile action, but then elects to return to peaceful conduct he is brought back under the effects of Aura of Truce and must spend willpower to break free again.%0a%3c %0a%3c * Fuel Rage (oooo)%0a%3c Same but it functions in the Shadow and may be activated repeatedly in succession prior to Gauru to stack extra turns. Fuel Rage may be used a number of times each day equal to the Werewolf's [Primal Urge/2], rounded up. Regardless of the number stacked, shifting down ends all invocations of the Gift.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!Insight Gifts%0a%3c %0a%3c * Sense Emotion (o)%0a%3c -%3cCost: None%0a%3c -%3cDice Pool: None%0a%3c -%3cActivation: Reflexive%0a%3c -%3cAll emotions have a scent, the hot of hatred, spice of attraction, heaviness of depression. An Uratha who knows this gift can sense these auras. When activating this Gift the Werewolf specifies a specific emotion they want to sniff out. For the remainder of the scene they can smell said emotion as well as they can any other scent. Roll Wits + Composure + Wisdom for all perception rolls to smell the chosen emotion. Creatures trying to hide their emotions may roll Composure + Power Stat to resist, and magical effects go into roll off vs. Sense Emotion.%0a%3c This effect endures for the duration of the scene, and the Werewolf may reactivate this Gift at any time to change the emotion for which they are hunting. (Note: Unlike Aura Sight [M:tA pg. 206] this Gift cannot sniff out supernatural templates. However, Aura Sight remains a good guide as to how each emotion would feel.)%0a%3c %0a%3c * Scent of Taint (oo)%0a%3c -%3cScent of Taint lasts for one full scene.%0a%3c -%3cCost: None%0a%3c -%3cDice Pool: None%0a%3c -%3cAction: Reflexive%0a%3c The Werewolf heightens their occult senses to the point where they can literally smell supernatural phenomena, allowing him to catch the distinct scents of all supernatural effects within his area. Beings, objects, locations, all fair game. The scents are nonspecific but generally give a sense of the nature of the magic and vague descriptor (person, place, or thing). This effect is always active and is "pinged" when a supernatural power or phenomena occurs when in range.%0a%3c Scent of Taint does not reveal the source of a magical effect, it merely makes it possible to seek out magic based on its supernatural nature alone. The Werewolf must still roll Wits + Composure to spot a supernatural entity, and hidden people/objects/locations are not automatically revealed. (Note: For the more rules obsessed, a magical occlusion effect, like invisibility or a ward, is itself considered to be occluded). This gift allows a Clash roll versus Obfuscate, Wits + Investigation + Wisdom.%0a%3c -%3cSuggested Modifiers%0a%3c -%3c+2 | The Uratha has smelled the effect before%0a%3c -%3c-1 | There are a number of other supernatural effects already active%0a%3c -%3c-3 | The source hidden by magical occlusion%0a%3c %0a%3c * Omen Gazing (ooooo)%0a%3c -%3cThe Werewolf specifies a potential topic on which they long to dream. This may be as vague as "Coming Danger" or as specific as "My Best Friends Moment of Death". They proceed to fall into a long trace, during which they may take no action and are totally unaware of the outside world. Only extreme trauma, such as violent shaking or receiving damage, can shake them from this trance.%0a%3c Alternatively, they may opt to remain unspecific in which case the Storyteller is encouraged to provide them with disjointed and cryptic visions of critical challenges yet to come. Key word here is cryptic, really, really cryptic.%0a%3c -%3cCost: 2 Essence%0a%3c -%3cDice Pool: Resolve + Occult + Wisdom%0a%3c -%3cAction: Extended.%0a%3c -%3cSuccess: The vision lasts for one minute per success, each granting a different vision. If the Werewolf is seeking for a particular event or omen the visions will generally revolve around it, showing different aspects leading up to and resulting from the event. Otherwise it will show the Uratha tidbits of random, but meaningful events in their life. These visions are not restricted to future portent alone. When relevant Omen Gazing will show snapshots of past and even current events.%0a%3c -%3cDramatic Success: The vision focuses very specifically on the key components of one event, notably those that conspire to bring about that particular future, and how it may be averted.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!Inspiration Gifts%0a%3c %0a%3c * Camaraderie (oo)%0a%3c -%3cCost: 1 Essence%0a%3c -%3cRoll: Presence + Persuasion + Glory%0a%3c -%3cAction: Instant%0a%3c -%3cDramatic Failure: The inspiration fails and embitters the Uratha. The user cannot gain teamwork bonuses for the remainder of the scene.%0a%3c -%3cFailure: The speech is not inspiring%0a%3c Success: The Uratha binds all subjects into a pact of unity. Everyone in the group gains +1 to resist Death Rage, (max [Glory] or [Successes], whichever is lower) for every other member within close proximity (~10 yards). Additionally all members gain a +2 modifier on all teamwork rolls to help one another. These bonuses last the remainder of the scene.%0a%3c %0a%3c * True Leader (ooo)%0a%3c True Leader targets a single willing ally within 100 feet of the user. That person must be able to hear, or at least see the user's show of support for the Gift to function.%0a%3c %0a%3c * Spirit Skin (oooo) %0a%3c Change: The social bonus does not stack with bonuses from renown, but will alleviate penalties. When two bonuses clash the higher is applied to the roll.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!Knowledge Gifts%0a%3c %0a%3c * Traveler's Blessing (oo)%0a%3c -%3cDuration: [Success] Hours%0a%3c %0a%3c * Know the Path (oooo)%0a%3c -%3cChange: When a location has multiple inhabitants use the highest of their Resolve + Power Stat to resist. Know the Path rolls off against supernatural occlusion, it is not automatically trumped. Additionally, this roll is penalized in the same way a Mage's sympathetic magic would be. Locations that are foreign or unknown to the Werewolf suffer a significant penalty to find through the use of this Gift.%0a%3c -%3cModifiers:%0a%3c -%3c+0 | A Good Friend or Pack Mate is there.%0a%3c -%3c-2 | The Werewolf has friends or acquaintances at the location%0a%3c -%3c-4 | The Werewolf is only lightly accustomed to the location%0a%3c -%3c-6 | The Werewolf knows the location by hearsay alone%0a%3c %0a%3c * Communion with the Land (ooooo)%0a%3c The Werewolf becomes aware not only of the number of creatures in the area, but of their general location as well. Being's not magically veiled are immediately located, while those with supernatural stealth roll off against the Gift's effect.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!Mother Luna Gifts%0a%3c %0a%3c * Quicksilver Rearrangement (ooo) [Replaces Silver Jaws]%0a%3c Mother Luna teaches that the physical form is temporary, a template that can change at any time. Using this Gift a Werewolf can spread wounds and damage across their body, repositioning them to less critical locations and generally dispersing the harm. A bloody gash across the neck might be broken into a dozen smaller cuts on the arms and legs, a gaping hole in the chest might be shifted to bloody lacerations across the back. %0a%3c This gift cannot be used to regenerate a crippling wound, a missing eye or leg cannot be restored. Nor can it be used to totally remove damage completely, merely downgrade it to a lesser severity.%0a%3c -%3cCost: 2 Essence%0a%3c -%3cDice Pool: Stamina + Survival + Primal Urge%0a%3c -%3cActivation: Reflexive%0a%3c Success on the activation roll allows the Uratha to downgrade Lethal or Aggravated damage to a lower level. A single Aggravated wound is becomes two lethal wounds, and a single lethal wound is downgraded to two bashing. The wounds are downgraded at one point per action, for [Success] actions, starting on the action in which this Gift is activated. While active the Werewolf may take actions as normal, but suffers a -2 penalty to all physical rolls due to the shifting of his form. Only one instance of this effect may be active at any one time.%0a%3c %0a%3c * Primal Form (ooooo)%0a%3c -%3cCost: 1 Essence and 1 willpower%0a%3c -%3cDice Pool: This power requires no roll%0a%3c -%3cAction: Instant%0a%3c Same, but change: Primal Form is an enhancement to Gauru and consumes Gauru turns at the same rate. If the Werewolf enters Death Rage while in Primal Form (very likely), he remains in Primal Form for the duration. If a werewolf enters Death Rage outside for Primal Form, he may reflexively activate Primal Form (assuming he can pay the cost).%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!Nature Gifts%0a%3c %0a%3c * Speak with Beasts (o)%0a%3c -%3cDuration: One Scene%0a%3c %0a%3c * Plant Growth (oo)%0a%3c -%3cCost: 1 Essence%0a%3c %0a%3c * Nature's Vengeance (ooooo)%0a%3c -%3cCost: 1 Essence and 1 Willpower%0a%3c -%3cEffect: Same, but; The area effected is equal to [(Purity + Successes)*5] square yards. And the Uratha can specify individuals to be spared the world's fury at the activation of the Gift. However, once active he cannot add new exemptions.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!New Moon Gifts%0a%3c %0a%3c * Sense Weakness (o)%0a%3c The player chooses the area about which they want to glean information. This Gift cannot be used, successfully or unsuccessfully on the same target more than once per day.%0a%3c %0a%3c * Distractions (ooo)%0a%3c -%3cDice Pool: Manipulation + Subterfuge + Cunning%0a%3c -%3cSuccess: The victim is distracted by the Irraka's illusions. In combat this inflicts a -2 penalty to all actions through confusion and annoyance. This penalty is greater when the target's mind is less focused. If the target is caught unawares by this attack (Ambushed, for instance), or generally unfocused (standing guard on a quiet night, hung over, etc.) the penalty becomes the higher of [Cunning] or -2.%0a%3c %0a%3c * Blend In (oooo)%0a%3c Add the following: The anonymity extends to the Irraka's scent as well, and inflicts a -[Successes+Cunning] penalty on all attempts to track, chase or otherwise follow the Irraka through a crowd. Even if located the Irraka remains almost indistinguishable, levying the same penalty on future attempts to accurately recall his appearance or actions during the scene.%0a%3c This rolls off vs. supernatural powers as normal.%0a%3c %0a%3c * Ghost Step (ooooo)%0a%3c Duration: [Success+Harmony] Minutes, the -1 rule applies for remaining longer.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!Rage Gifts%0a%3c %0a%3c * Rekindled Rage (oooo)%0a%3c -%3cCost: 1 Willpower (+1 Essence)%0a%3c -%3cDice Pool: None%0a%3c -%3cAction: Instant (Reflexive)%0a%3c The user may opt to spend one point of Essence instead of making the shape change roll, in which case this Gift becomes reflexive. The new rage has a duration of Stamina+Glory-1, and suffers and additional -1 to resist Death Rage. The Uratha may use Rekindled Rage any number of times within a scene, however each activation adds a cumulative -1 to Gauru's duration and the roll to resist Death Rage.%0a%3c %0a%3c * Fight or Flight (ooooo) (Replaces Soured Rage)%0a%3c The Werewolf hones his rage and directs it with laser precision at a single target. The victim is struck with a sense of absolute, primal dread and an instinctive urge to flee. %0a%3c -%3cCost: 1 Willpower%0a%3c -%3cDice Pool: Presence+Intimidation+Glory vs. Composure+Power Stat%0a%3c -%3cAction: Instant%0a%3c -%3cDramatic Failure: The Werewolf loses control over his own fury and enters Death Rage%0a%3c -%3cFailure: The target remains steadfast%0a%3c -%3cSuccess: The victim's higher mind is whipped away, instinct and fear now drive him. In the case of a Werewolf the target immediately enters Death Rage and attempts to flee as though one of his last three health boxes were filled. Other creatures with similar "rage" mechanics respond similarly, Vampire's enter Fear Frenzy, Prometheans plunge into Torment. Beings without naturally berserk tendencies are still filled with pure dread and compelled irresistibly to flee the scene. They may, however, opt to spend a point of willpower to divert an action towards grabbing up a loved one, or locking a door behind them (continued combat is never an option).%0a%3c -%3cExceptional Success: Willpower may not be spent to change actions, the target can only run with all their might away from the Uratha.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!Shaping Gifts%0a%3c %0a%3c * Reinforce (o) [Replaces Straighten]%0a%3c -%3cCost: 1 Essence%0a%3c -%3cDice Pool: Intelligence + Crafts + Honor%0a%3c -%3cAction: Reflexive%0a%3c The Werewolf calls upon the tiny spirit of an object, bolstering it with essence and renewing it in purpose. Each success on the activation roll adds 1 point to the object's durability for the remainder of the scene. This does not in any way repair a damaged object, nor can it grant use to an object that has been completely ruined (though he might still be able to use a reinforced object for unintended function, like bashing things). At the end of the scene the durability fades, damaged suffered does not. In many cases this can cause the object to collapse.%0a%3c %0a%3c * Condense or Expand (ooooo)%0a%3c Same effect, but: Objects shrunk do not become more durable, and those enlarged do not become less so.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!Stealth Gifts%0a%3c %0a%3c Swap Running Shadow and Blending's dot ratings.

Strong winds blow away prints in the sand, leaves quickly cover his footfall. This effect permanently increases the difficulty to track the Werewolf, levying a -3 penalty on all such attempts. For even greater anonymity the Werewolf may reflexively spend a point of Essence, doing so removes all physical traces of his passage what-so-ever. He leaves no foot prints and has no lingering scent, he also reduces all environmental penalties to his movement by 2. Though, this application bears some extra risk; bystanders may think it odd to see a man striding atop a six foot snow drift without sinking, or blazing through hip deep sludge at full sprint.%0a%3c %0a%3c * Blending (ooo)%0a%3c Change: The user may move slowly, no more than slow walk, while the Gift is active, but Wits + Composure rolls made to spot him while he does so gain +3.%0a%3c %0a%3c * Shadow Flesh (ooooo)%0a%3c -%3cCost: 2 Essence%0a%3c -%3cDice Pool: Wits+Stealth+Cunning%0a%3c -%3cAction: Instant%0a%3c -%3cSuccess: The character's body becomes a two-dimentional plane of shadow that lies flat against its surroundings. He has no scent, no texture, and makes no sounds save for those he chooses to emit. However he remains a physical entity, retains the ability to interact with the physical world, albeit at a -2 penalty, and may still be affected by opponents attacks. His form appears as normal (in whichever of his forms he currently takes), however the Uratha can twist his shape to resemble other shadows. Doing so requires a successful [Dexterity+Stealth] roll to contort his form, and even then his edges tend to waver.%0a%3c Being a shadow grants the Werewolf a +3 bonus to steath rolls, in inflcts a -3 penalty on all rolls to notice or attack him (In areas of particularly dim lighting the Werewolf is effectively invisible, save to those with supernaturally excellent senses). In addition to these bonuses he also gains a host of mobility options. He may scale walls and ceilings with no required roll, fit through slim and narrow openings, and never needs to roll to maintain his balance. Due to his complete two dimensionality the Werewolf is also immune to any attempts to grapple or restrain him physically.%0a%3c All clothing and personal possessions worn change along with the character, though large unwealdly objects are left behind. Fetishes and dedicated objects always change. This form lasts for ten minutes per success, or until the Werewolf elects to end the Gift.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!Strength Gifts%0a%3c -%3cAre awesome.

The object's owner may make an Extended Intelligence + Crafts roll to attempt to fix the object. The difficulty of said roll is equal to the number of successes rolled on Left-Handed Spanner's activation roll. The interval of the action is decided by the storyteller based on the devices complexity, along with any bonus or penalties from the character's own expertise.%0a%3c %0a%3c * Create Technology (oooo)%0a%3c The MacGyvered device functions for the remainder of the scene, or until the Werewolf stops using it (whichever is longer). Only the devices creator may use it to its full effect, for everyone else it remains a hunk of useless scrap. (A gun hobbled together from scrap metal would cease to function at the end of a fight, while a scrap car given new life might endure a full day of driving before collapsing into a heap of rust and debris.)%0a%3c %0a%3c * Machinegeist (ooooo)%0a%3c In addition to all other effects of Machinegeist, the Uratha may control the machine completely, employing it to any of the functions for which it was designed. Mundane attempts to arrest control from him (such a steering the car, or slamming on the breaks) fail, though controlling magic enters roll off.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!Warding Gifts%0a%3c -%3cWard Against Humans is now one dot. Ward Against Predators is gone, and replaced by Ward Against Rage.%0a%3c %0a%3c * Ward Against Humans (o)%0a%3c Supernatural creatures who fail the resistance roll take a -1 penalty to all actions in the area, due to the lingering sense of predatorily presence. Given the way the ward is constructed, natural predators tend to stay away as well. They can tell that it is the territory of a superior beast.%0a%3c %0a%3c * Ward Against Rage (oo)%0a%3c One of the simplest precautions a Werewolf can take to secure their territory is to defend it against his own rage, and that of others. %0a%3c -%3cCost: None%0a%3c -%3cDice Pool: Composure + Persuasion + Honor%0a%3c -%3cAction: Extended (5 Successes per square mile required; one hour per roll)%0a%3c The Werewolf ritually walks the boundaries of her territory (a maximum area equal to one square mile per point of the character's Primal Urge). She takes the time to familiarize herself with the objects and places within, and show their spirits she means no harm. This act brings an unnatural tranquility to the zone. Add +3 to any rolls by the character to resist Death Rage within her territory. Additionally this calm spreads to other within the zone, all other Uratha (and supernaturals with a similar tendency to go berserk) gain +1 to resist Deathrage (Torment, Frenzy etc.), pack mates gain +3 instead, and all rolls made to inspire hostility, fear, or hatred are made at a -2 penalty.%0a%3c %0a%3c * Shadow Ward (oooo)%0a%3c -%3cCost: 2 Essence (+1 Essence)%0a%3c -%3cDice Pool: Inteligence+Occult+Honor%0a%3c -%3cAction: Extended (Variable Successes, One hour per Roll)%0a%3c -%3cChange: Each successful roll increases the penalty for crossing or seeing through the Gauntlet by one. The Werewolf may continue to reinforce the shadow for up to [Honor] hours. The difficulty of each roll varies depending on the location, generally ranging from 1 for simple rifts, to 5 for powerful Loci. Repeat invocations of this Gift do not stack, the most powerful casting takes precedence. While the effect lasts only one Lunar Cycle, it may be renewed by repaying the Gift's cost and meditating at the location for a single hour, no roll required. The renewer of the Ward need not be the original caster.%0a%3c For an additional point of Essence while enacting the Ward the Uratha may added exceptions, loopholes in the veil that allow certain beings easier passage. Sample exceptions include: "Is a member of the creators pack", "serves the Lodge of Black Arrows", or "Carries a key of pure gold". The exceptions themselves have no intelligence, nor can they read the motivations of others, so "Will be helpful" and "Means the pack no harm" are not viable conditions. Up to [Honor] exceptions may be placed when the ward is created, and once placed they may not be altered without first removing (or replacing) the previous ward.%0a%3c %0a%3c * Ward of Spirit Slumber (ooooo)%0a%3c Change: Duration is now one minute per success. While activating the Ward he may specify nearby allies to be immune to the effect, by default all pack mates and their totem are excluded from the wards effects. The Werewolf may use this Gift as many times per day as he likes, but a Spirit need only resist it once to be immune for the next 24 hours.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!Weather Gifts%0a%3c %0a%3c * Silent Fog (oo)%0a%3c -%3cCost: None%0a%3c %0a%3c * Killing Frost (oooo)%0a%3c -%3cCost: 1 Essence%0a%3c -%3cDice Pool: Manipulation+Survival+Honor%0a%3c -%3cAction: Instant%0a%3c Success: The temperature surrounding the Werewolf suddenly plunges, dropping to sub zero within 10 yards per dot of Honor (Or Primal Urge, whichever is higher). All liquid that would reasonably freeze does so immediately, surfaces frost up, rain becomes hail. Living creatures suffer worst of all, for every action spent within the freezing field they must succeed a reflexive [Stamina] roll or take two points of bashing damage. Creatures particularly vulnerable to freezing (such as sealife) take lethal damage instead, while creatures immune (Undead, Cold Spirits, Automata, etc) do not suffer. In addition, everyone in the area vulnerable to cold takes a -2 penalty to all strength and dexterity related rolls. At storyteller discresion heavy clothing and proper (or improper) preparation may add to or penalize the resistance roll.%0a%3c This field lasts for one turn per success on the activation roll. The caster may choose while activating this gift to attune a number of allies to the cold, immunitizing them to the Gifts effects. By default all packmates and their totem are naturally attuned. Multiple activations of this Gift do not stack, even if different characters are using it.%0a%3c -%3cDramatic Success: the cold is so severe it deals lethal three points of bashing damage instead of two.%0a%3c %0a%3c * Thunderbolt (ooooo)%0a%3c -%3cCost: 2 Essence%0a%3c -%3cDice Pool: Manipulation+Survival+Honor - Stamina%0a%3c -%3cAction: Instant%0a%3c -%3cSuccess: The bolt deals two lethal damage per success. Magical armor sources (Rage Armor, Mage Armor, etc.) are added to the target's stamina when defending. As the damage is lighting based, creatures immune to electricity are unaffected (or, in Promethean's case, healed).%0a%3c [[#HouseRulesEnd]]%0a\ No newline at end of file%0a---%0a> [[#SocietyEnd]]%0a\ No newline at end of file%0a

They're fucking tough sons-of-bitches. There are some among the People that think they're too high for our own good, but you won't see me growling it where they can hear."'' - Crooked Grin, Alpha of the Dirty Dozen%0a%3c %0a%3c '''Membership:''' 5 Members (All Auspices)%0a%3c %0a%3c '''Alpha:''' Eddie Reynolds (Lord Frostbite)%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!Organization%0a%3c %0a%3c The Lords of Mourning Glory are organized in a traditional pack setup and are one of the few packs to maintain a member of each auspice. They are made up of veterans of the Brethren War, each auspice represented by an Elder. The pack is primarily constructed of Storm Lords, but claims one Hunter-in-Darkness as its Irraka. The pack maintains the fealty of several "lesser" packs with less experienced members who take advantage of the older pack's knowledge and social standing. The lesser packs serve as enforcers, each pack's totem possessing loyalty to Mourning Glory's Ithaeur for binding them to their current children through moonlit rituals. The members of the pack are:%0a%3c %0a%3c * Eddie Reynolds (Alpha - Cahalith / Storm Lord / Lodge of Thunder)%0a%3c * Micha Forerunner (Second - Elodoth / Storm Lord / Lodge of Winter)%0a%3c * Aaron Dahl (Ithaeur / Hunter-in-Darkness / Lodge of the Shephard)%0a%3c * Mike Tanner (Irraka / Storm Lord / Lodge of Crows)%0a%3c * Buck One-Eye (Rahu / Storm Lord / Lodge of Thunder)%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!The Lesser Packs%0a%3c %0a%3c There are five packs that owe fealty to the alpha pack. These packs are young and brash werewolves, easily impressed by displays of strength and dominance. The Mourning Glory keeps a leash on their charges by possessing knowledge of each totem's ban and possessing rites to summon, bind, or discorporate a totem if any of the lesser packs become unwilling to listen to instructions.%0a%3c %0a%3c This makes the enforcers of the Mourning Glory compliant, but also slightly resentful. Yet still what these packs are getting out of the arrangement is more than what they're losing...for now. The packs each claim memberships in different lodges, with some being more prominent than others. There are members of every tribe represented among the numbers of the lesser packs. The packs are:%0a%3c %0a%3c * Hellriders / Membership: 7 (Totem: Iron Horse)%0a%3c * Headhunters / Membership 3(Totem: The Bloody Huntsman)%0a%3c * Hanging Judges / Membership 4(Totem: The Hangman)%0a%3c * Dirty Dozen / Membership 12 (Totem: Snapping Dog)%0a%3c * Bad Moon Rising / Membership 3 (Totem: Old Creeper)%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!The Oath of the Moon%0a%3c %0a%3c ''See: [[WtFLaw|Werewolf Law: Oath of the Moon]]''%0a%3c %0a%3c The laws of the Oath are open to interpretation depending on who you ask. However, even among the contentious ranks of the Tribes of the Moon, there are some general guidelines that are observed...%0a%3c %0a%3c * Those packs that are members of the Hegemony are free to interpret the Oath as they see fit within their territories. The rule of an individual pack and their leadership is law as long as they can continue to hold their territory.%0a%3c %0a%3c * The People Do Not Murder The People: This law has a more liberal interpretation in the Clutch. The Pure Tribes are not considered to be "of the People," and some packs even go so far as to include non-affiliated werewolves as well.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!Wolf-Blooded Families%0a%3c %0a%3c There are several families of Wolf-Blooded that exist in Savannah and just as many werewolves that claim blood ties or marriage to members of these families. Wolf-Blooded see more interaction with werewolves than usual, and some try to curry favor with the packs in hopes of gaining advantage over rival families, family members, or to improve their social standing among the packs.%0a%3c %0a%3c The wolf-blooded tend to interact with humanity on behalf of their lycanthropic brethren. There are some that do so out of a sense of familial duty, or perhaps they mistakenly believe that currying favor will somehow earn them the same powers as the werewolves. This is a mistaken belief, but it is not without a source. There is one pack in particular that  keeps knowledge of skinchanging rituals stolen from an old witch that was an ancient enemy of the People.%0a%3c %0a%3c This knowledge is taught to Wolf-Bloods that prove themselves and are unlikely to experience the First Change. The Blooded are often used to try and gain advantage over rival packs, or to clean up after the werewolves' hunting of the threats that hide in the darkness of Savannah's swamps and back alleys.%0a%3c %0a%3c :The Skinners:This Wolf-Blooded Family maintains secrets of Skinchanging, closely guarded by the werewolves that control them. They have branched into several smaller branch families that work on behalf of the uratha. (Possible Sur-Names: Dorian, Tanner, Dahl)%0a%3c %0a%3c :The Pinkertons:This Wolf-Blooded Family typically has involved themselves in law enforcement. This may not be true of every family member, but typically members of this family have gone on to become police officers and sheriffs. The family maintains a close connection to the police and the District Attorney.%0a%3c %0a%3c :The Reynolds: There are some Wolf-Blooded that are more impacted by the touch of the Shadow than others. This Family is one such case. The members have been known to be the targets of spirit possession and worse, but such attention from the spirits has also granted them access to strange alien connections in the Shadow and thus the ability to act as mediums. The Family claims an old Native American heritage, and members that have those features are considered of "finer breeding" than those without.%0a%3c [[#SocietyEnd]]%0a\ No newline at end of file%0a---%0a> [[#Law]]%0a\ No newline at end of file%0a

They use a different code of conduct to judge themselves and each other. These laws are ancient and passed down from ancient times by Mother Moon and her lunes. Yet not every pack or Elodoth interprets the laws in the same light. Yet generally most packs can agree on certain laws meaning the same thing. If there are any contentions as to the meaning of the law, it is best to adhere to the intepretation of the pack's territory that you are in - or else seek to take their territory away.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!The Wolf Must Hunt%0a%3c %0a%3c It does not matter what the wolf hunts, only that it does. This is the most basic tenet of the Oath and speaks to the nature of the uratha as predators. If a predator does not take up the Hunt - either for territory, sustenance, or simply pleasure they are seen as denying a vital part of werewolf existence. This could weigh on their souls, and other werewolves may perceive them as lazy and weak.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!The People Do Not Murder The People%0a%3c %0a%3c In Savannah, the local packs tend to agree that the "People" are only those werewolves who are members of the Tribes of the Moon. If a werewolf has not pledged himself to the Oath or has joined the ranks of the Pure there will be little reprecussion for their death. It is possible for packs to perceive any werewolf not of the pack as being not of the People. Thus any werewolf traversing through unfamiliar territory had best take care, lest he turn form hunter into hunted.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!The Low Honor The High; The High Respect The Low%0a%3c %0a%3c This law serves as a lesson against hubris, yet is commonly the most broken vow. The majority of packs offer those of renown and accomplishment their due, yet there are some others who respect only strength and those with the power to ''make'' them listen. In either scenario, the Alpha-pack of the Whispering Pines Hegemony is considered the highest authority in Savannah. Lord Frostbite regularly holds meetings with the leadership of the local packs, settling disputes or trying desperately to keep the grudges between the packs in check.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!Respect Your Prey%0a%3c %0a%3c This law is much like the previous, but carries with it certain significance. The werewolves prey upon spirits, hosts, humans, and sometimes stranger creatures. This law primarily is meant to be certain that the uratha do not abuse either their spirit charges or their human relations. They may hold power over flesh and spirit, but restraint is respected and expected from the leadership. This doesn't always happen, and often the Wolf-Blooded or unaffiliated mortals are the victims of packs who do not cling so tightly to this tenet.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!The Uratha Shall Cleave To The Human%0a%3c %0a%3c This is the only law of the Oath that is held completely inviolate in Savannah. There is no excuse for its breach, and werewolves that trespass into this taboo may face exile or grisly execution. If a female werewolf is pregnant with a growing Ghost Child, it is likely that the local packs will seek to kill her to prevent its birth. The father may receive more mercy, but that is up to the individual pack that captures him.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!Do Not Eat The Flesh Of Man Or Wolf%0a%3c %0a%3c There may be instances where a werewolf loses control. That is to be expected. There are no werewolves who can claim to have never felt the death of their minds, consumed in their Rage. Yet werewolves are expected to abstain from eating the flesh of humans or wolves or, worse yet, their own kind. There are rumors of packs of Predator Kings that lurk out in the deep wilderness that sometimes venture closer to the city, causing disappearances of hikers or rural folk. The rumors say that they feast on the flesh of men. It shows the Tribes just how far they can potentially fall if they ignore this tenet. All packs enforce this law, and breaches are usually handled in pack.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!The Herd Must Not Know%0a%3c %0a%3c This law is typically enforced by sending in clean-up crews of Wolf-Blooded or lower ranking werewolves in the Hegemony after a reported breach. The secrecy of the uratha must be maintained, but sometimes the packs are driven into a corner and must fight or die. However, acting in a manner or taking actions that risk the exposure of the uratha is cause for harsh and vicious punishment. If a werewolf can not clean up their mistakes they may find the local packs soon knocking on her door.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!Punishment and Enforcement%0a%3c %0a%3c * Every pack is expected to police and manage their own members. Failure to do so adequately may attract the attention of their neighbors, resulting perhaps in withdrawal of resources and aid against the local Pure Tribes or even outright hostility.%0a%3c %0a%3c * Individual werewolves without a pack are afforded less protection than those with a pack. If you're packless and accused of committing a breach of the Oath, expect to be treated harshly. Thus, there is more encouragement to become a member of a pack for that political protection.%0a%3c %0a%3c * If a pack falls so low in Harmony as to display signs of obvious degeneration or the development of bans, it's possible they may gain the attention of the Alpha-pack. To date, there has been no such case of an entire pack falling to such extremes. It is unknown what measures would be taken if any of the lesser packs did fall so low.%0a%3c [[#Law]]%0a\ No newline at end of file%0a---%0a> [[#LocationEnd]]%0a\ No newline at end of file%0a

This collection of forest and marshland is a powerful focus of spiritual energy, a place where leylines from across the land connect and cause the creation of loci. The Heart of the Forest is a powerful locus, offering rich stores of essence filled with a resonance of nature and decay.%0a%3c %0a%3c The laws of the wild are reflected in startling brutality on the other side of the barrier where spirits predate on one another, creating a treacherous domain full of entities that keep secrets buried deep underneath the water.

This piece of pristine wilderness is where the packs come together to interact and create ever shifting allegiances. There is a central bonfire that is lit at night to provide illumination, and werewolf Gifts have hollowed out the ground beneath the meeting spot, creating a council chamber where the packs' leaders and representatives can meet privately to discuss policy and future actions.%0a%3c %0a%3c This meeting chamber is a vast underground room, fortified by the living roots of the trees above. There exists in the central chamber a table, crafted from a still living tree, and a seat for every representative of each pack that claims membership in the Hegemony.%0a%3c %0a%3c It is rumored that sometimes spirits or stranger entities come calling on the werewolves for their own reasons, offering promises and favors in exchange for support in their own causes.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!Loci%0a%3c %0a%3c The Hegemony maintains several powerful loci, made possible only by the combined might of the packs aligned underneath the Alpha pack. This organization is rarely found among the Forsaken packs, but it has offered undeniable benefits:%0a%3c %0a%3c * Werewolves who are members of the Hegemony have an easier time accessing Essence to fuel their powers. They gain one Essence point per day, but may me rewarded with more for acting in service to the Hegemony.%0a%3c %0a%3c * Werewolves have access to the Shadow from any of the loci that dot the wilderness. The spirit wilds are "relatively" tame here and not as dangerous to traverse until you're one mile away from Hegemony territory.%0a%3c %0a%3c * Werewolves receive +1 to resist Death Rage and teamwork rolls while visiting the Tur. The use of Inspiration Gifts is periodically carried out to promote an atmosphere of cooperation and reduce the strain on a visiting werewolf's instincts.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!Wards & Guardians%0a%3c %0a%3c This is the center of Forsaken power in Savannah. The collective efforts of the packs underneath the Lords of Mourning Glory have yielded mighty protections. These protections are to maintain the security of the protectorate as much as keep its prisoners inside. There have been several incidents of attempted release of the totems locked inside their "cells" by the Pure Tribes.%0a%3c %0a%3c * Ward vs Humans / Bind Human: Any human (including Mages, Ghouls, Wolf-Blooded, and Sleepwalkers) attempting to enter into the wilderness feel a sensation of powerful foreboding that prevents entry. Wolf-blooded in service to the local packs are offered special tokens that allow them to ignore this effect. The token takes the form of a pine cone marked by the head ritualist's blood. This effect extends to 50 yards.%0a%3c %0a%3c * Rite of Moon's Love: Those Wolf-blooded who come to the werewolves to fulfill some matter of business or to perhaps curry favor form their relations receive this ritual. Thus they are offered some additional protection from Lunacy during their visit.%0a%3c %0a%3c * Wake the Spirit: There are spirit-awakened trees that serve as sentries into the territory. These spirits will alert the totems of every pack inside the area of intruders.%0a%3c %0a%3c * Rite of Chosen Ground: The spirit wilds have been reshaped to reflect the chosen qualities of the local packs. This is usually reflected in a resonance of nature or of the Hunt. A werewolf will receive +1 to actions involving survival while in the area.%0a%3c %0a%3c * U.S Fish & Wildlife Service: Wolf-blooded employed by Fish & Wildlife will routinely patrol the borders of the refuge, looking for both poachers and enemies of the People.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!The Lesser Packs%0a%3c %0a%3c There are five packs in total that owe fealty to the Lords of Mourning Glory. They act as enforcers for the protectorate, and usually will back any actions that are put forth by the Alpha pack. However they have their own internal grudges and motivations that may put them at odds with visitors or offer opportunities to get ahead in the bloody and violent politics of the Hegemony.%0a%3c [[#LocationEnd]]%0a\ No newline at end of file%0a---%0a> [[#History]]%0a\ No newline at end of file%0a

The Lodge of Wendigo is a lodge that has secret rituals for gleaning secrets and skills from consuming the flesh of your enemies. Their totem, the infamous Wendigo, has always maintained a often overlooked presence in the area.%0a%3c %0a%3c '''(1732)-''' The British arrive, led by General James Oglethorpe. The colonists are mostly humans, but there is one Wolf-blooded Family and their werewolf relations that comes over. This pack is made primarily of Bone Shadows. They have a few things in common with the Bone Shadows that exist amongst the Natives, and tribal relationships among the werewolves actually fosters the healthy relationship that fostered among the English colonists and the Natives here.%0a%3c %0a%3c '''(1736)-''' The Face Witch is killed by the combined efforts of the packs. The Witch had been an old enemy of the werewolves for years before British colonists arrived. The witch had been, in fact, a powerful and corrupt mage that maintained a great amount of lore on shapeshifting and the art of stealing the flesh of her victims and taking their appearances. This power she used to experiment on werewolves she managed to capture, trying to steal their power. Her writings are presumed destroyed, but the contents are secretly maintained by one of the packs.%0a%3c %0a%3c '''(1752)-''' There exist several werewolf packs scattered among the wilderness and in the colonist settlement. These packs sometimes fight one another over territory and exceptional humans or wolf-blooded that attract intents to breed. %0a%3c %0a%3c '''(1754)-''' Georgia becomes an official royal colony. This receives mixed reactions from the local packs. The werewolves, for the most part, don't care; but the influx of slavery begins to attract the Pure Tribes and they begin to create a foothold in the colony.%0a%3c %0a%3c This breeds an era of violent turmoil as the Forsaken close ranks to resist the advances of the Pure in both the flesh and the spirit. The concept of slavery is tolerated by some of the Forsaken packs later, but packs that either endorse the practice have a high rate of members who join the Pure; lured by their speeches of dominance over humanity.%0a%3c %0a%3c The Forsaken lend their assistance to the Quakers and other mortal groups that facilitate the Underground Railroad, disrupting slave trading whenever possible to strike at Pure influence in the colony.%0a%3c %0a%3c '''(1773)-''' The Natives, specifically the Creek and Cherokee, secede more land to the English. This causes a change in the spirit world as young artificial-spirits begin to become more common and nature-spirits begin to fight back. The different broods and choirs gain support from different packs, and rivalries begin to cause bloodshed.%0a%3c %0a%3c The fight with the Pure is put on hold, and slavery continues unabated while the Forsaken struggle between themselves. This brings some of the same effect among the Pure, but not to the same extent.%0a%3c %0a%3c There is a marked rise in Rites of Initiation being conducted for newly changed joining the Iron Masters. The Fire Touched heighten their own attempts at recruitment by infiltrating local churches, delivering fire and brimstone speeches and targeting mortal groups through religious zealotry. This campaign is resisted by the Iron Masters and Bone Shadows who spread a message of Enlightenment and some of the early literature leading to the American Revolution is influenced by the Tribes of the Moon.%0a%3c %0a%3c '''(1778 American Revolution)-''' British and Loyalist troops primarily control the city for much of the war. There are several sieges to take the city by American and French forces, but they fail. The werewolves are too embroiled with their own conflicts, but some packs help the American and French forces covertly by delivering anonymous intelligence.%0a%3c %0a%3c The Pure, for their part, do not care for either cause. They are restricted in their movements by the heavy presence of troops. There is an unofficial ceasefire between the two warring factions of werewolves.%0a%3c %0a%3c '''(1864 American Civil War)-''' The Pure Tribes, with their holdings in the slave market and plantations back the Confederacy. The Union by default receives the backing of the Tribes of the Moon, many local packs of Forsaken are brought into a deadly "civil war" of their own as werewolves from both factions move to slaughter and burn the holdings and loved ones of their enemies.%0a%3c %0a%3c The writings and techniques of the old witch that the packs had killed in 1736 resurface. These occult rituals are used on wolf-blooded who are unlikely to experience the First Change, adding a mass of new shapeshifters to the forces of the Forsaken. This brings mixed reactions from some of the Native American packs, but this action turns the tide and allows the Union forces to take hold.%0a%3c %0a%3c It is two months into Union occupation that General Sherman begins introducing his concept of "total war." The destruction caused by the Union forces and the slaughter of those they captured breeds dark places in the spirit world. The Union brings the end of slavery, but births many new terrors that the weakened Forsaken must struggle to contain. The Pure Tribes go into hiding to lick their wounds.%0a%3c %0a%3c '''(19th Century)-''' The Forsaken begin to fall to fighting among themselves. The different packs begin to fight over resources and territory. This soon begins what the werewolves call the Brethren War, when the Pure Tribes rise up and begin taking territories. They kill or convert any werewolves they encounter. %0a%3c %0a%3c The local packs are pushed to the brink before one of the packs rises to push back the Pure Tribes, gathering a collective of packs beneath them. This is the start of the Clutch...%0a%3c %0a%3c '''(Modern Day)-''' The Forsaken have reclaimed many of the territories that they had lost during the Brethren War, but are divided clearly into lines of North and South. To the South the Pure Tribes hold sway with their message of hate and manipulate the mortal populations through hate groups, spirit possession, and extreme religious doctrine.%0a%3c %0a%3c The Tribes of the Moon hold the territories to the North of the city. They maintain a powerful collection of loci and resources, but are constrained by instincts that refuse any kind of central governance. The Alpha pack however has continued to hold themselves above the other "lesser packs" and maintained a firm grip on control, creating a dangerous and violent game of politics where cunning and strength are both needed in equal measure.%0a%3c [[#History]]%0a\ No newline at end of file%0a---%0a> (:table:)%0a\ No newline at end of file%0a
