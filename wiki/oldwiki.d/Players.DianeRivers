Roughly a year and a half ago, in the spring of 2012 she escaped to Savannah and quickly joined up in the spring court after being helped establish herself in the mortal and fae world thanks to ''[[HarrisFisher|Harris Fisher]]''. She has kept a low profile for the main part, helping the Freehold whenever needed without trying to shine in any glory. Around the winter of 2012/2013 she ran into recent refugee from the Hedge ''[[MarissaCollins|Marissa Collins]]'' who is, since then, staying at her place.%0a%0a'''Mask:''' There's little to nothing but a hazy blur about Diane before she was taken from the mortal world. She was most likely not from Savannah but rather from somewhere else in Georgia. Like many other changelings she either doesn't want to talk too much about it or she simply doesn't remember.%0aAs for after her escape she found herself in Savannah and tried her hardest to blend into society. She got an average part-time job at a supermarket, a dog to take for walks and plays in a local female soccer team. Alot of her mask life is based around trying to be as human as possible and this includes doing and caring for human things, or at least what she thinks is human things. The most exciting she ever does is to work extra every now and then as security during festivals and what not.%0a[[%3c%3c]]%0a%0ahttp://wantonwicked.gamingsandbox.com/wiki/images/ctl/headers/ctl_rph.png%0a'''Kick it!''' (Anyone)[[%3c%3c]]%0aDiane is the team-captain of an all woman's non-professional soccer team called Savannah Queens. They play in a low-division league with games every second weekend near the Savannah area and training sessions a couple of hours every week. Maybe you're a fellow player, someone who has participated in a tournament or just someone who enjoys watching the games? If not, maybe you visit one of the gyms that Diane goes to on a weekly basis?%0a%0a'''Out for a walk?'''

While she might not be the first one to break the ice she will very much enjoy finding a play-friend for Winston.%0a%0a'''Off to the movies!''' (Anyone)%0aDiane Rivers has an interest in movies and enjoys going to watch them at the cinema. She actually enjoys movies that much that she joined a film-club in Savannah! For whatever reason she enjoys drama and romance while feeling a strong discontent for horror, fantasy and other supernatural themed movies. Maybe you joined her in the film-club, maybe you went together?%0a%0a'''Party like you mean it''' (Changeling)[[%3c%3c]]%0aIf you ever spent time at a spring court party then you'd know that there are two different Diane Rivers. One that is the silent, a little bit drawn back Diane which is commonly there, and one that lets loose and releases everything.
