The place has been vacated and abandoned for years until it was purchased by someone recently who has been restoring it. %0a%0aSeen from a real-estate brokers perspective, the house is nearly worthless or at least it was. Not only has previous owners included two counts of criminals as well as the house having a reputation among the locals, but it's also located too far from the city for most people's taste despite 17 speedway boulevard leading any car owner there in less that 20 minutes. The piece of land comes with too little property to hold any true value, but since autumn in 2011, the house has been under serious reconstruction and it's starting to look like a decent home again. %0a%0aThe place was once the home of a wealthy family, but it has changed owners many times over. It's not even a farm anymore. It was purchased by a fund not even two years ago, no one officially has residence there at the moment, officially being the key word, as the pack NIL makes it their home, and are currently restoring it, step for step. %0a%0aWhen Hunter found the place, he purchased it through an anonymous family fund, his name not on the deed, though it does though other legal paper-works belong to him. %0a%0aThe last actual owners of the place were a biker gang who attempted to use it as a Meth-lab but ended up poisoning themselves (locals might remember this). Before them though, the last owners defaulted on their loan in 1963 and went bankrupt, leaving the place in a poor state only to grow worse. Even before that, in the 1920'ies, the family that had owned the property the longest, the original family that built it were forced to sell it when several men in the family were arrested for moon-shining. %0a%0aOwners of the place gradually turned it from an open range farmhouse into a compound, with the wall having been built along with the fallout shelter in the 50'ies when many American's feared the Communists. %0a%0a%0a%0a%25%25http://wantonwicked.gamingsandbox.com/wiki/images/wtf/headers/wtf_d.png%0aThe road passes the house a bit to the east, as a small gravel road loads up next to the property taking a turn right into the property, making it impossible to even see the entrance from the road. %0a%0aThe gravel-road directly from one of the smaller roads off Alligator Alley, but any visitors are warded off by an old sign that says "private property" and a sign indicating that it's a blind road. %0a%0aThere is no mailbox, road name or address sign or anything else prompting curious by-passers to take a look. %0a%0aThe house itself is not visible from the road, as the entire property is shielded by trees that were planted decades ago, to offer the family that lived there privacy from the open naked fields that surrounds the property, and this is not at all an uncommon sight (also often used to trace the border of one man's property separating it from the neighbors). A slightly more uncommon sight are the heavy bushes growing by the bottom of the trees making it very hard to see through the thin line of trees. %0a%0aImmediately behind the trees, the property is fenced in, not a measure to keep people out, but a measure to keep the animals roaming the property in. The fence is rusted and old, being an old 2.1 meters tall chain-link fence with barbed wire on top. There are few places where animals seem to have dug their way under the fence, allowing for foxes, rats and cats to slip under. %0a%0aAbout 3 meters past the fence, is an old crumbling wall that traces the same line as the fence. The wall is just about 3 meters tall and with all it's small cracks and holes, it would be easy to climb if it wasn't for the glass-shards that were glued on top. The wall is is about half a meter thick, and has several, what appears to be flooding vents appearing as square shaped holes in the bottom, now mostly used by the various small animals occasionally wanting to enter or escape the property. %0a%0aThe drive way leads through the only hole in the completely square line of trees and through an old metal gate that doesn't seem to close or open easily anymore, having been left open the past few years. %0a%0aThe house is found just to the right of the entryway. The property is quite large, most of it used to keep horses on. There is a small riding track and a large barn found in a part of the property which is fenced in separately, by far the largest part and roamed mostly by the two stallions that belongs to the owner of the property, one golden colored, the other chestnut. There are small square shaped holes in in the gates leading from section to section, allowing animals up to the size of a large dog to pass through unhindered. %0a%0aThe barn is very large and split in two, one half used as a garage, the other has two functional boxes for horses, that doesn't see any use, and several stands for what could be cattle. The smaller part of the property was supposed to be a garden, but apart from what appears to be a small kitchen garden, and and old green house which is completely covered in bird feces and fungus, is pretty much just grass growing wild. There is a small chicken yard fenced in on it's own, just by the house, which seems to be populated by quite a few hens and their offspring, suggesting the presence of a rooster as well. Two dogs live on the property, one is an oddly gray colored German Shepard, a very large dog in fact, and the other is a smaller, leaner hunting breed of some kind in light brown colors. Both dogs are male, and have a shared dog-house in the garden area. A lot of cats seem to roam the property unhindered, most of them farmland cats. %0a%0aThere is an entrance to a storm-celler which was later refashioned into a fallout shelter. The stairs leading down there are rusted and broken, missing several steps, the air ducts full of dirt and and vermin nests, what ever food was stored down there once has most likely gone bad after being torn into by rats, explaining the terrible odor. Full of moist, the little concrete cell hasn't been properly vented in years. It's barred off with chains and a padlock. %0a%0aPainted white, built entirely in bricks, the house is made to look like an old European-style home, with fake black bindings painted unto it, and brand new red tile-stones. Not terribly large, the house still has 4 wings, as it was designed with a small atrium in the middle, featuring a tiny pond. Most of the furniture in the house is ancient, and the current owner doesn't have the kind of money needed to buy antiques that match, and besides, most of it is in terrible condition. Originally featuring tapestry on all walls, many rooms now have been repainted, while others have crumbling tapestry that looks older than the house itself because of the moist that once plagued the house. Many rooms have their own fireplaces, and the roof is dotted with chimney's but most of them are clogged because they remained unused for long as radiators have since been installed, most of which have also stopped working. The windows have all been replaced with new modern windows, most of them were broken and boarded up not long ago. Old curtains are drawn making it impossible to look inside most of the rooms. %0a%0aThe ground floor contains all the practical rooms and social rooms, including a formal living room (takes up entire right wing), and a less formal one (found in front wing - actually mostly a trophy room, used as TV room and has one of two functioning fireplaces in the house - adorned with hunting trophies none of which are very exotic), a dining room (takes up the entire left wing - contains a large long table that was once intended to be able to host the entire family, extended family, friends, neighbors, other guests and household all at once), a large kitchen (takes up entire back wing - not functional), a large bathroom (main bathroom, front wing, also only functional bathroom in the house out of several). A small kitchen with room to dine in (found in the front wing - only functional kitchen out of two). %0a%0aThe Second floor is mainly living quarters, and a few hobby rooms, but the second floor is still under heavy renovation, some rooms don't even have floorboards at the moment. The Master Bedroom has been redone, and is found in the front wing, and takes up half the front wing. There is a study across the hall from the master bedroom, facing inwards with a balcony facing the atrium. there's also a bathroom which is almost restored, but still out of order. The left wing has a 3 small bedrooms, and a bathroom that is out of order, but otherwise just has a lot of space. It was once a servant wing, where the workers on the farm lived and had space to perform their duties such as ironing and sewing, and probably served as their own living room as well. The Right wing contains two rather large bedrooms, and an inwards facing tea-room/ladies living room, that probably once looked beautiful. Now there's a broken piano in there that is too heavy to haul out, and and some worn down furniture. Here is also an out of order bathroom, rather small though. The back wing contains what appears to be a hobby room, being just one big room, but it has no floorboards anymore. %0a%0aThe attic, or the fake third floor, looks from the outside like an entire third floor, but upon taking the newly  replaced stairs up there, one will find that it's in fact an attic, that is, sort of split into a half floor. There are no rooms on the third floor, but it certainly looks like there once was a third floor, and a separate attic, but this has changed in recent time, probably a result of the heavy renovation the place has been under through the ages as countless of owners have attempted to keep the building standing. %0a%0aThe basement is relatively simplistic. Concrete floor, concrete walls a few windows, a washing room, and a few other rooms containing the boiler, an old generator (works but not in use) and an old heater (works but rarely in use). A single room has a few almost ancient samples of gym equipment, that looks like they're barely usable anymore, except for the free-weights. A relatively limited selection, but enough to get a full work-out by most people's accounts. The basement looks newer than the rest of the house. One room seems dedicated as a small wine-cellar as it has old wine bottle racks, but there is not a single bottle to be found in there, and one of the racks has collapsed. %0a%0aThe place was once considered secure, but the truth of the matter is, that anyone wanting to get in can easily do so. Stepping through the thick bushes, cutting through the chain-link fence and using a hammer to bash down then glass-shards, and a simple doormat to lay over the remains, and voila, entrance is granted, avoiding the main gate (which is usually open anyway). It's terribly hard to get in without leaving a trace however, unless walking through the main gate, and even harder to do so without making a lot of noise. More importantly, it's very hard to even get a look at the property from the outside, which was always the true intent of the "fortifications". Despite several alarm-stickers and neighbor watch stickers being found on practically every window including the gate, there is no neighbor watch in the area, and there is no security company who has this property on their list of clients. There is an alarm system, very old but it is disabled as it serves no function anymore, though any would be burgers will likely find that the presence of even a disabled alarm system makes the idea of a security vehicle showing up all the more likely. There are several stickers warning intruders that there is CCTV, but there actually aren't any cameras anywhere. There are regular security vehicles on the roads out this way, because many other nearby properties are clients of actual security companies. %0a%0a%0a'''Resonance:''' The area surrounding the house has a faint resonance of fear while the place itself has a resonance of security. Seen from the outside, the trees seem darker, the bird song coming mostly from crows and ravens has a foreboding tune to them, the wild hedges and bushes are uninviting and look suspiciously much like they have thorns. The gravel road looks so long and exposed, the house itself still looks haunted, with countless of windows you could swear you just saw someone watching you from. The worn out wall surrounding the place looks like it might collapse on you if you tried climbing it. When inside, the place appears much like a fortress however, the foreboding feeling passes and is replaced by a territorial feeling of safety and security. Now, all the scary things from before, are between you and the world. \\%0a'''Territory:''' [[http://wantonwicked.gamingsandbox.com/wiki/index.php?n=Players.NIL|NIL]]%0a[[#locationend]]%0a%0a----%0a(:include CityBook.Directory:)

A small kitchen with room to dine in (found in the front wing - only functional kitchen out of two). %0a%3c %0a%3c The Second floor is mainly living quarters, and a few hobby rooms, but the second floor is still under heavy renovation, some rooms don't even have floorboards at the moment. The Master Bedroom has been redone, and is found in the front wing, and takes up half the front wing. There is a study across the hall from the master bedroom, facing inwards with a balcony facing the atrium. there's also a bathroom which is almost restored, but still out of order. The left wing has a 3 small bedrooms, and a bathroom that is out of order, but otherwise just has a lot of space. It was once a servant wing, where the workers on the farm lived and had space to perform their duties such as ironing and sewing, and probably served as their own living room as well. The Right wing contains two rather large bedrooms, and an inwards facing tea-room/ladies living room, that probably once looked beautiful. Now there's a broken piano in there that is too heavy to haul out, and and some worn down furniture. Here is also an out of order bathroom, rather small though. The back wing contains what appears to be a hobby room, being just one big room, but it has no floorboards anymore. %0a%3c %0a%3c The attic, or the fake third floor, looks from the outside like an entire third floor, but upon taking the newly  replaced stairs up there, one will find that it's in fact an attic, that is, sort of split into a half floor. There are no rooms on the third floor, but it certainly looks like there once was a third floor, and a separate attic, but this has changed in recent time, probably a result of the heavy renovation the place has been under through the ages as countless of owners have attempted to keep the building standing. %0a%3c %0a%3c The basement is relatively simplistic. Concrete floor, concrete walls a few windows, a washing room, and a few other rooms containing the boiler, an old generator (works but not in use) and an old heater (works but rarely in use). A single room has a few almost ancient samples of gym equipment, that looks like they're barely usable anymore, except for the free-weights. A relatively limited selection, but enough to get a full work-out by most people's accounts. The basement looks newer than the rest of the house. One room seems dedicated as a small wine-cellar as it has old wine bottle racks, but there is not a single bottle to be found in there, and one of the racks has collapsed. %0a%3c %0a%3c The place was once considered secure, but the truth of the matter is, that anyone wanting to get in can easily do so. Stepping through the thick bushes, cutting through the chain-link fence and using a hammer to bash down then glass-shards, and a simple doormat to lay over the remains, and voila, entrance is granted, avoiding the main gate (which is usually open anyway). It's terribly hard to get in without leaving a trace however, unless walking through the main gate, and even harder to do so without making a lot of noise. More importantly, it's very hard to even get a look at the property from the outside, which was always the true intent of the "fortifications". Despite several alarm-stickers and neighbor watch stickers being found on practically every window including the gate, there is no neighbor watch in the area, and there is no security company who has this property on their list of clients. There is an alarm system, very old but it is disabled as it serves no function anymore, though any would be burgers will likely find that the presence of even a disabled alarm system makes the idea of a security vehicle showing up all the more likely. There are several stickers warning intruders that there is CCTV, but there actually aren't any cameras anywhere. There are regular security vehicles on the roads out this way, because many other nearby properties are clients of actual security companies. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c '''Resonance:''' The area surrounding the house has a faint resonance of fear while the place itself has a resonance of security. Seen from the outside, the trees seem darker, the bird song coming mostly from crows and ravens has a foreboding tune to them, the wild hedges and bushes are uninviting and look suspiciously much like they have thorns. The gravel road looks so long and exposed, the house itself still looks haunted, with countless of windows you could swear you just saw someone watching you from. The worn out wall surrounding the place looks like it might collapse on you if you tried climbing it. When inside, the place appears much like a fortress however, the foreboding feeling passes and is replaced by a territorial feeling of safety and security. Now, all the scary things from before, are between you and the world. \\%0a%3c '''Territory:''' [[http://wantonwicked.gamingsandbox.com/wiki/index.php?n=Players.NIL|NIL]]%0a%3c [[#locationend]]%0a%3c %0a%3c ----%0a%3c (:include CityBook.Directory:)%0a\ No newline at end of file%0a
