There is details, though not very clear that she has one brother, and both her parents are still alive, however she rarely talks about them.  She started writing the Twisted World Series when she was just 15.  She's often seen at the San Diego Comic Con, as well as other Cons.  There has been a rumor floating around the internet and boards that one of the major networks is trying to turn Twisted World's into a TV Series.''%0a---%0a> ''Southern Cali girl born and raised.
